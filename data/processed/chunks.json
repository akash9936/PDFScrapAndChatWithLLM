As a simple example, let us take the period of KÀlidÀsa's life: how are we to reconcile the fact that KÀlidÀsa who claims to be the court poet of king VikramÀditya of Ujjain is the court poet of the king Chandragupta II VikramÀditya of PÀtaliputra. A further inconsistency: KÀlidÀsa refers to VarÀhamihira as his senior contemporary but the modern textbooks of history teach us that KÀlidÀsa lived in the 5th century CE whereas VarÀhamihira was supposed to have lived in the 6th century CE. Seemingly simple inconsistencies but requiring an extraordinary amount of erudition, a command over Sanskrit and amateur astronomical knowledge to be able to validate the celestial events recorded in the wealth of epigraphic records in this country. There are many such anomalies in the modern chronological history of ancient India that need dedication, erudition and patience but unfortunately for us, 'eminent historians' preferred to brush such inconsistencies aside rather than promoting honest, unbiased research to resolve them. Western historians nurtured a bias towards the traditional chronology of ancient India to further their own political and academic interests and the majority of the historians of independent India carried forward the same legacy, patronised by the certain sections of political establishment. The entire edifice of the chronology of ancient India was erected on false foundations during the colonial period. While many scholars attempted to expose the fallacy of the distorted Indian chronology with\nxii THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA reference to the Puranic chronology, unfortunately none studied the chronological content of the inscriptions comprehensively to reconcile with Puranic and astronomical inputs. The present research work is completely based on the comprehensive study of the chronological content of the inscriptions. During the course of my research, I have discovered the exact epochs of various ancient Indian eras that conclusively uphold the authenticity of the Puranic chronology and expose the fallacy of the chronology given in the modern textbooks of Indian history. There is a serious need to re-write the entire history of ancient India with reference to the newly discovered epochs of the ancient Indian eras. During my study of the mathematical and astronomical contributions of ancient India, I noticed some serious problems in the chronology of ancient Indian astronomers. Fortuitously, I met Dr. K. Aravinda Rao, former DGP (Andhra Pradesh) in February 2014 and presented him my first book titled \"Indian Contributions to Mathematics and Astronomy\". In return, he gifted me the entire set of books written by Kota Venkatachalam. The historical research work of Kota Venkatachalam inspired me to take up the original study of the epoch of ancient Indian eras based on the dates mentioned in various inscriptions. I sincerely thank Dr. K. Aravinda Rao who introduced me to the invaluable historical research of Kota Venkatachalam. I express my profound gratitude to Sh. PPS Hariprasad, former Director (Finance), ECIL and worthy descendant of the family of great astronomers, who patiently calculated certain ancient dates for me whenever I approached him.

PurÀõas relate the chronology of the political history of ancient India starting from the SÂrya VaÚœi king IkœvÀku to the kings of the Gupta dynasty. There is abundance of epigraphic, archaeological and literary evidence for the critical study of the chronology of ancient India. Unfortunately, by 10th and 11th centuries CE, the exact epochs of certain ancient eras were forgotten. This led to many inconsistencies and contradictions in our chronology. In the last 231 years, Western historians and their followers took advantage of these inconsistencies and distorted the entire chronology of ancient India. They concocted many false theories and managed to take modern Indian historical research in the direction that suited their purpose. As a matter of fact, the chronic and complex problems in the study of ancient Indian chronology arise from a misunderstanding of the epochs of various eras. As unanimously accepted by all historians, inscriptions are the most valuable source of ancient Indian chronology but the inscriptional or epigraphic evidence is available only after the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha. For the period beyond the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha, only literary evidence is available. Indian inscriptions generally record the date with reference to the epoch of a particular era. Interestingly, many Indian inscriptions contain verifiable details of the dates. Since ancient Indians evolved many astronomical siddhÀntas, they seem to have followed different schemes of calendars for the purpose of referring to dates. The tithi, nakœatra, intercalation, weekday, etc. mentioned in the inscriptions can be verified with reference to the specific calendric siddhÀnta applied in those days. But we have no other option",

Indian calendric siddhÀntas have been revised and updated from time to time. Therefore, certain details like intercalation, weekday, etc. may not be in line with the currently available Indian calendric siddhÀntas. Interestingly, many inscriptions refer to solar and lunar eclipses occurred on the dates that are eternally verifiable astronomical events irrespective of the calendric siddhÀnta followed. Therefore, I have considered the references to solar and lunar eclipses as the strongest evidence to calculate the exact epoch of the era referred to in the inscriptions. Based on the study of solar and lunar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions, I was able to determine that the Œaka era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era commenced in two different epochs. Also, KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in two different epochs. In general, by the 10th and 11th centuries CE, Indians had come to accept that the Œaka or ŒÀlivÀhana era commenced in 78 CE and that the KÀrttikÀdi or ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. ‘Eminent’ historians of modern times also believed in these two epochs only, though they knew that many references of solar or lunar eclipses in the inscriptions cannot be explained by these two epochs. They simply conjectured that Indians referred to certain solar eclipses themselves on the basis of calculations though the eclipses were not visible in India. As ancient Indians celebrated the days of eclipses as festivals, it is totally absurd to conclude that Indian kings celebrated solar eclipses that were not visible to them. Actually, a section of historians never honestly attempted to study the epoch of various eras with reference to Puranic chronology. Since Western historians rejected the Puranic history of ancient India as mythology, a certain section of historians also blindly followed them. Consequently, the entire chronology of ancient India got distorted. I have attempted to study the epoch of various eras with reference to the eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions and the literary evidence. According to my study, the Œaka era commenced in 583 BCE whereas the ŒÀlivÀhana era commenced in 78 CE. Similarly, I have found that\n3 the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 719-718 CE whereas the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. Based on these epochs, I have also discovered the exact epoch of other ancient eras and presented the chronology of ancient India with reference to epigraphic and literary evidence in the forthcoming chapters. Interestingly and very gratifyingly, I found that the most of the epigraphic evidence is in agreement with the literary evidence. The antiquity of Vedic civilisation, probably stretches back to the beginnings of Holocene as appears from the archaeological, genetic and astronomical studies. In fact, the Indus-Saraswati civilisation was an advanced phase of Vedic civilisation and it declined gradually due to the disappearance of Saraswati River around 3500-3000 BCE. Therefore, Vedic civilisation is the oldest continuous civilisation that started its journey around 10,000 BCE and we, Indians are the direct descendants of this glorious civilisation. Undoubtedly, the banks of Sapta Sindhu (Saraswati, Sindhu and five Rivers of Punjab) were the original homeland of Vedic civilisation. It is not out of proportion to say that the region of Sapta Sindhu was the cradle of human civilisation. There are numerous astronomical references in the Vedas (Ref.",

    "content": ") that point to the antiquity of Vedic civilisation up to 10,000 BCE. According to the latest report of Archaeological Survey of India, the mounds at Bhirrana village, on the banks of the Saraswati (Ghaggar) River, in Fatehabad (near Hisar) district of Haryana date back to 7570 BCE. It is also proven in the genome studies that India’s population mix has been broadly stable for over 10,000 years. PurÀõas are the ancient chronicles of India that recorded the chronology of royal dynasties starting from the earliest king IkœvÀku of SÂrya VaÚœa. Interestingly, Pliny, the elder (23-79 CE) mentions that “from the time of Father Liber’s [Dionysos] to Alexandrus, 153 kings of India are counted in a period of 6451 years and three months.” Thus, the chronological history of Indian royal dynasties goes back to 6776 BCE (6451+325). The first SÂrya VaÚœi king IkœvÀku probably flourished around 6800-6700 BCE. Indian astronomy started evolving during early Vedic period. Initially, ancient Indians followed smaller yugas for astronomical INTRODUCTION\n4 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA calculations. The span of a Yuga was probably 1200 years and possibly, the KÃta Yuga was from 6700 BCE to 5500 BCE, the TretÀ Yuga from 5500 BCE to 4300 BCE and the DvÀpara Yuga from 4300 BCE to 3100 BCE. MÀndhÀtÀ, a descendant of the IkœvÀku lineage and the most illustrious King of the KÃta Yuga (MÀndhÀtÀ sa mahÁpatiÍ KÃtayugÀlaôkÀra- bhÂto gataÍ)1 flourished around 6200 BCE. It is stated in the SÂrya SiddhÀnta that Maya authored the earliest version of the SÂrya SiddhÀnta at the end of the KÃta Yuga.2 Maya probably wrote the famous SÂrya SiddhÀnta around 5600-5500 BCE. The recent research by I-SERVE (Institute of Scientific Research on Vedas) has concluded based on the sky views, generated through Planetarium software, of planetary references in the VÀlmiki RÀmÀyaõa that RÀma was probably born on 10th January 5114 BCE during the TretÀ Yuga (5500-4300 BCE). MaharÈi VÀlmiki probably authored RÀmÀyaõa, the first kÀvya in classical Sanskrit around 5050 BCE was later updated. It appears that ancient Indian astronomers reviewed and updated the astronomical siddhÀntas at the end of the TretÀ Yuga around 4300 BCE based on the observational data collected over 1200 years. John Playfair, a Scottish mathematician had demonstrated in 1789 CE that the epoch of the astronomical observations recorded in the tables, still in use among Hindu astrologers, had to be 4300 BCE. According to ancient Tamil literature, the first Sangam was supposed to have been started by the Vedic Rishi Agastya. Totally, three Sangams were patronised by 89, 59 and 49 Pandyan kings respectively. According to KD Abhyankar, the star Agastya (Canopus) was known to Indians since the Rig Vedic period. The star Agastya became visible for the first time in India at KanyÀkumari around 10,000 BCE, at Chennai around 8500 BCE, at Hyderabad 7200 BCE, in the Vindhya region around 5200 BCE and at Delhi around 3100 BCE.3 The epoch of the Puranic story about Agastya who crossed the Vindhya Mountain cannot be later than 5000 BCE. Thus, the history of the 197 Pandyan kings of the Sangam period ought to have begun around 5000 BCE and the first Pandyan king may have belonged to the era of the RÀmÀyaõa i.e. 5100 - 5000 BCE. It is well known that the events of MahÀbhÀrata occurred around 3200-3100 BCE. The year of the MahÀbhÀrata war can be fixed around\n5 3128 BCE. The priniciples of Indian astronomy witnessed major revisions many times over a period of time. Finally, the epoch of Kaliyuga was fixed at the midnight between 17th and 18th Feb 3102 BCE when the Sun, Moon and the planets were in conjunction. Interestingly, the span of a Yuga was increased by 360 times and the concept of MahÀyugas and Manvantaras was introduced to ensure the accurate integer solutions for astronomical calculations. King YudhiÈÇhira ascended the throne after the MahÀbhÀrata war and his grandson Janamejaya probably started an era in memory of King YudhiÈÇhira. The epoch of the MahÀbhÀrata war, the epoch of YudhiÈÇhira era and the epoch of Kaliyuga came into use after 3000 BCE. Ancient Indians also observed that SaptarÈis (Great Bear) reside hundred years in one nakœatra constellation and completes one cycle of 27 nakœatras in 2700 years. Indians used this cycle of SaptaÃÈis as a calendar. Greek historians mention that Indians used the SaptaÃÈi calendar with the epoch in 6676 BCE. According to VÃddha Garga and VarÀhamihira, the Great Bear was in MaghÀ constellation during 3176-3077 BCE. The purÀõas were pure chronicles in ancient times but they have evolved into veritable encyclopaedias after the era of the MahÀbhÀrata. All PurÀõas available today were updated during the period from 500 BCE to 200 CE. Only the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta was written much later, probably around the 9th to 10th century CE. These PurÀõas provide valuable information about the chronology of royal dynasties of Magadha from the MahÀbhÀrata war to the period of the Gupta dynasty. A total nine dynasties ruled over Magadha from 3128 BCE to 92 BCE. In CE 1. BÃhadratha dynasty 3128-2122 BCE 2. Pradyota dynasty 2122-1984 BCE 3. ŒiœunÀga dynasty 1984-1616 BCE 4. Nanda dynasty 1616-1516 BCE 5. Maurya dynasty 1516-1217 BCE 6. Œuôga dynasty 1216-916 BCE 7. Kaõva dynasty 915-830 BCE 8. ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty 830-338 BCE 9. Gupta dynasty 338-92 BCE INTRODUCTION\n6 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA According to the PurÀõas, the Magadha Empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms after the fall of the Gupta dynasty. Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta tells us that the PÀla kings ruled over Magadha after the Gupta kings. Kalhaõa wrote a comprehensive history of Kashmir starting from the era of the MahÀbhÀrata in his RÀjataraôgiõÁ. Various RÀja-VaÉœÀvalis of Nepal also recorded the chronology of royal dynasties of ancient Nepal starting from the MahÀbhÀrata era. Traditionally, Indians have followed the Puranic chronology of ancient India till the 18th century CE. During the colonial era, Western scholars came to know about the Puranic chronology of ancient India but they could not bring themselves to believe it. Having been born and brought up in Christian society, their subconscious belief was likely based on Biblical chronology. Their racial bias also probably did not allow them to accept the Puranic chronology that was older than the chronology of ancient Greece. Western scholars completely rejected the Puranic chronology as mere mythology rather than history. They questioned the historicity of various royal dynasties mentioned in the PurÀõas and declared the RÀmÀyaõa as fiction and the MahÀbhÀrata as historical fiction. Interestingly, the same Western scholars selectively accepted the genealogy of some royal dynasties as mentioned in PurÀõas. Unfortunately, only literary evidence is available for the history of ancient India beyond the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha. Moreover, in due course of time, Indians completely forgot the real epoch of certain eras creating more confusion in fixing the chronology of ancient India. Western scholars simply concluded that literary evidence was contrary to epigraphic evidence, hence not reliable. They rejected the Puranic chronology and stressed upon modern Indian historical research based on epigraphic and archaeological evidence. Some scholars like John Playfair and Hermann Jacobi have logically argued that the antiquity of Vedic civilisation goes beyond 4300-4500 BCE but the majority of Western scholars simply brushed aside the irrefutable facts presented by them. William Jones (1746-1794 CE) founded “The Asiatic Society” in Calcutta on 15th Jan 1784 and laid the foundation for modern Indian historical research. Western scholars were fascinated with the victories of Alexander from their childhood and started searching for traces of Alexander in the history of ancient India. Firstly, William Jones rather\n7 deliberately identified the “Sandrokottus” mentioned by the Greek historians to be Chandragupta Maurya. The Indian King Samudragupta of the Gupta dynasty was, in fact, the contemporary of Alexander and this is also supported by Puranic chronology. Therefore, Samudragupta must be identified as “Sandrokottus” and not Chandragupta Maurya (Ref.",

    "content": "). Some scholars like Mr. Troyer rightly pointed out this mistaken identity but Western scholars upheld this mistaken identity as eternal historical fact to facilitate the distortions in the chronology of ancient India. The mistaken identity of “Sandrokottus” became the sheet-anchor theory for reconstructing the chronology of ancient India leading to numerous concoctions and distortions later on. A majority of Indian historians accepted this mistaken identity as an irrefutable historical fact because the epigraphic evidence of other dynasties based on the wrong epoch of eras also supported it. Secondly, as Indian chroniclers completely forgot the epoch of certain eras by 11th century CE, it was rather easy for a section of modern historians to draw erroneous conclusions about the dates and eras referred to in ancient inscriptions of India. The issue of the mistaken identity of “Sandrokottus” cannot be settled without an in-depth study of the eras referred to in the inscriptions. The present research work is all about reconstruction of the chronology of ancient India based on a critical study of the dates and eras referred to in inscriptions. I have considered the epigraphic evidence as primary and literary evidence as secondary. Surprisingly, I found that Western historians had unreasonably rejected many inscriptions as “spurious” or “forgery” because they do not fit into the chronology of ancient India as perceived by them. Instead of accepting the error in the identity of “Sandrokottus”, Western scholars not only distorted many historical facts brazenly but also concocted many myths and presented them as ‘historical facts’. Western scholars and colonial historians never made a serious and honest effort to reconcile Puranic chronology and the chronology derived from the epigraphic evidence. This resulted in entire body of modern Indian historical research being led in the wrong direction over the last 231 years. INTRODUCTION\n8 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA During the study of inscriptions, I found that the chronology derived from the epigraphs is absolutely in line with Puranic chronology. I also found that all inscriptions are genuine if we follow the real epochs of certain eras. For instance, majority of historians simply assumed that both the Œaka and the ŒÀlivÀhana eras commenced in 78 CE though the details of many inscriptions cannot be verified with reference to the epoch of 78 CE. The study of Indian inscriptions reveals two distinct epochs i.e. the coronation of the Œaka king and the death of the Œaka king. The epoch of the death or the end of the Œaka king commenced in 78 CE. The same epoch was referred to as the ŒÀlivÀhana era later. Historians generally conclude that the epoch of 78 CE was earlier referred to as the coronation of the Œaka king and the same was referred to as the death of the Œaka king later. But it is an egregious blunder committed by the historians. The inscriptions clearly indicate two different epochs of the Œaka era. Undoubtedly, the epoch of the death of Œaka king commenced in 78 CE. Later, this was referred to as the ŒÀlivÀhana era. The Kurtaketi copper plates of the early Chalukya king VikramÀditya and the Hyderabad copper plates of Pulakeœin II unambiguously indicate the untenability of the epoch of 78 CE. These two inscriptions provide the strongest verifiable details of solar eclipses that cannot be explained with reference to the epoch of 78 CE. Ridiculous conclusions were drawn like the one that Indians occasionally referred to the solar eclipses on calculation basis only though they were not visible in India. Traditionally, Solar and lunar eclipses are observed piously in India even today and such ‘eminent historians’ want us to believe that Indian kings celebrated the occuring of invisible solar eclipses? Actually, the incorrect epochs of eras considered by the historians led to these absurd conclusions. The Kurtaketi and Hyderabad copper plates refer to the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king and not the epoch of the death of the Œaka king. The Kurtaketi plates4 are dated in the year 530 elapsed from the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king. It refers to the total solar eclipse that occurred on the new moon day of the VaiœÀkha month in Northern Karnataka which ended around noon. The following ten total solar eclipses occurred in Northern Karnataka (considering the latitude 15:55 N and longitude 75:40 E of Badami) during the period 1500 BCE to 1500 CE.\n9 1. 13th Aug 1416 BCE 2. 27th Jul 1257 BCE 3. 4th Mar 180 BCE 4. 9th May 53 BCE 5. 27th Jan 111 CE 6. 25th Jun 754 CE 7. 20th Aug 993 CE 8. 23rd Jul 1134 CE 9. 6th Nov 1268 CE 10. 9th Dec 1322 CE The data shows that there was only one total solar eclipse that occurred in Northern Karnataka on the new moon day of VaiœÀkha month i.e. 9th May 53 BCE that started at 09:04 hrs and ended at 11:45 hrs. The day was the new moon day of VaiœÀkha month (between VaiœÀkha and JyeÈÇha months) and the moon was in RohiõÁ nakœÈatra. The Sun and Moon were also in VÃÈabha rÀœi i.e. Taurus sign. The Hyderabad copper plates5 of Pulakéœin II are dated in the year 534 elapsed from the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king. These plates refer to the occurrence of a solar eclipse on the new moon day of BhÀdrapada month i.e. 21st Aug 49 BCE. INTRODUCTION\n10 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Similarly, the Talamanchi (Nellore) plates6 of Chalukya VikramÀditya I are dated in his 6th regnal year i.e. 1 BCE - 0 CE and refer to a solar eclipse that occurred on the new moon day of the ŒrÀvaõa month i.e. 31st Jul 1 BCE. This solar eclipse was visible at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. The three solar eclipses mentioned in the copper plate inscriptions of the BÀdÀmi Chalukyas cannot be explained with reference to the epoch of the death of the Œaka king i.e. 78 CE. It is evident that the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king is different from the epoch of the death of the Œaka king. Considering the year 530 elapsed in 53 BCE, it can be easily concluded that the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king commenced in 583 BCE. Since the calendar of the Œaka era was ChaitrÀdi\n11 and AmÀnta (a scheme in which month ends on new moon day), the epoch of the Œaka era ought to have commenced on 19th Feb 583 BCE. It is evident that the early Chalukyas of Badami flourished around 1st century BCE and not in the 7th century CE as established by modern ‘eminent’ historians. It is well known that the Gupta dynasty flourished before the Badami Chalukyas thus validating the correctness of Puranic chronology. Therefore, “Sandrokottus” must be identified as Samudragupta and not Chandragupta Maurya. An inscription found in Shimoga district of Karnataka refers to an annular solar eclipse (Valaya grahaõa) that occurred on Chaitra pratipadÀ i.e. the 1st tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month in the year 861 of the Œaka era.7 Considering the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king in 583 BCE, 277-278 CE was the 861st year of the Œaka era and the annular solar eclipse occurred on 20th Feb 277 CE. The above mentioned references to solar eclipses found in the inscriptions clearly indicate that the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king and the epoch of the death of the Œaka king are different. Evidently, the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king commenced in 583 BCE whereas the epoch of the death of Œaka king or the end of the Œaka era commenced in 78 CE. Therefore, we have to study the inscriptions dated in the Œaka era carefully to find out the exact epoch for reconstructing the chronology of a particular dynasty. INTRODUCTION\n12 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Similarly, a section of historians considered only one epoch of the Vikrama era that commenced in 57 BCE. It is well known that the inscriptions dated in the Vikrama era followed two different calendars. One calendar was the KÀrttikÀdi (New Year starting from the month of KÀrttika) and another was the ChaitrÀdi (New Year starting from the month of Chaitra). It is evident from the inscriptions that the KÀrtikÀdi calendar is older than the ChaitrÀdi calendar. KÀlakÀcÀrya-KathÀnaka of Jaina tradition tells us that KÀlakÀcÀrya persuaded the Œakas to invade Ujjain and they defeated Gardabhilla, the king of Ujjain. After four years, VikramÀditya defeated the Œakas and established the MÀlava kingdom and founded an era known as the Krita, MÀlava-gaõa or Vikrama era. After 135 years, the Œakas again invaded Ujjain and established their kingdom. The VikramÀditya mentioned in Jaina literature flourished 135 years before the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king i.e. 583 BCE. Therefore, VikramÀditya founded an era in 719-718 BCE and the calendar was KÀrttikÀdi. The chronology of various dynasties which refer to KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era in their inscriptions must be reconstructed with reference to the epoch of 719-718 BCE. It can be concluded that the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 719-718 BCE whereas the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. Though Indians adopted the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka era (583 BCE), probably, Indian astronomers were not comfortable in using this epoch for various astronomical calculations. They not only wanted to do away with the epoch that started in commemoration of the coronation of a tyrant MleccÍa king but also felt the necessity to establish a new epoch because the epoch of the Œaka era was not comfortably placed with reference to the epoch of the Kaliyuga era for accurate astronomical calculations. Thus, Indian astronomers discovered the perfect epoch in the year 78 CE when 3179 years elapsed from Kaliyuga era and linked it with the epoch of the death of the Œaka king or the end of the Œaka era. Since the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era followed the KÀrttikÀdi calendar, a necessity was also felt to introduce a ChaitrÀdi calendar during the 2nd century CE. During the process of introducing the ChaitrÀdi calendar,\n13 Indian astronomers reset the epoch of Vikrama era in 57 BCE with reference to the epoch of 78 CE ensuring a similar gap of 135 years. Thus, the epochs of 78 CE and 57 BCE were actually introduced by Indian astronomers and became so immensely popular in India by the 11th century CE that Indians completely forgot the epochs of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). We have to segregate the inscriptions dated in the Œaka era and the Vikrama era into the following four categories to work out the chronology of various dynasties. 1. Inscriptions referring to the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka King (583 BCE) 2. Inscriptions referring to the epoch of the death of the Œaka king (78 CE) 3. Inscriptions referring to the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) 4. Inscriptions referring to the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) Western historians wrongly calculated the epochs of the Sri Harsha, Kalachuri-Chédi and Gupta eras too. Alberuni clearly states that Indians used the Sri Harsha era that commenced 400 years before the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). Thus, the epoch of the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE. Western historians distorted the statement of Alberuni and created an epoch of fictitious era around 606 CE and named it the SrÁ Harsha era. Alberuni explicitly calculated and confirmed that the year 1031 CE to be 1488th year in the Sri Harsha era. Since Western historians were biased towards the distorted chronology of ancient India, they could not believe that Sri Harsha flourished earlier than the Mauryas. According to Puranic chronology, the Gupta dynasty started ruling in the 4th century BCE. The inscriptions of Gupta kings and their feudatories are dated in the Gupta era. Western historians concluded that both the epoch of Gupta era and the epoch of the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE. Alberuni apparently clarified that the epoch of the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE when the Gupta kings ceased to INTRODUCTION\n14 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA exist. Again, these historians distorted the statement of Alberuni and concocted that the Gupta era and the Valabhi era share the same epoch in 319 CE. Based on the references of four solar eclipses in the inscriptions dated in the Gupta era, I found that the epoch of the Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE (Ref.",

    "content": "). The earliest inscription of Samudragupta is dated in the 5th year of the Gupta era and Samudragupta ruled for 51 years. Therefore, Samudragupta flourished around 331 BCE to 280 BCE. It is evident that Samudragupta was the contemporary of Alexander & Seleucus Nikator and not Chandragupta Maurya. Thus, we have to consider the epoch of the Gupta era in 335 BCE and the epoch of the Valabhi era in 319 CE to reconstruct the chronology of ancient India. Eminent historians made every effort to find the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era but utterly failed to find one epoch. Historian VV Mirashi concluded that the epoch of the earliest inscriptions dated up to the year 490 commenced in 249 CE whereas the epoch of the later inscriptions dated from the year 722 to the year 969 commenced in 248 CE. This unusual approach of eminent historians not only gives a long rope to explain the dates mentioned in the inscriptions but also facilitates the justification of their distorted chronology. I analysed the solar and lunar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions dated in the Kalachuri-Chedi era and discovered that the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403-402 BCE and the calendar was KÀrttikÀdi (Ref.",

Some historians concocted that the inscriptions of ancient Nepal are dated in the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) but there is not even an iota of evidence to prove it. In fact, historians concocted an epoch of a fictitious era in 606 CE and propounded it to be the epoch of the Sri Harsha era. Since some ancient inscriptions of Nepal are dated in the Sri Harsha era, they simply concluded that the inscriptions of early LiccÍavi kings are dated in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Actually, the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE and the inscriptions of the early LiccÍavi kings used an ancient era that undoubtedly commenced much before 457 BCE. The epoch of the era used in the inscriptions of the early LiccÍavi kings may have\n15 commenced around 966 BCE; this is also evident from the oldest method of intercalation of PauÈa-°ÈÀçha months used in these inscriptions. This method of intercalation was in vogue during the VédÀnga JyotiÈa period (1400 BCE). Since Western historians mistakenly identified “Sandrokottus” with Chandragupta Maurya, they generally fixed the date of MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha around 486 BCE or 483 BCE considering Aœoka’s consecration around 268 BCE or 265 BCE. According to the Tibetan Sa-skya-pa tradition, Buddha attained nirvÀõa around 2134-2133 BCE. The King Aœoka mentioned in Buddhist literature was probably a Kashmiri king and Buddha may have attained nirvÀõa around 2134-2133 BCE. In case, the Aœoka of Buddhist literature was a Mauryan King, PurÀõas tell us that Aœoka flourished in the 15th century BCE; therefore, Buddha may have attained nirvÀõa in 1658 BCE. Therefore, the MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha cannot be dated later than 1658 BCE (Ref.",

Jaina sources tell us that MahÀvÁra attained nirvÀõa 605 years and 5 months before the commencement of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and 470 years before the commencement of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). Thus, MahÀvÁra attained nirvÀõa on 22nd October 1189-88 BCE. It is evident that the mistaken identity of “Sandrokottus” has brought forward the chronology of ancient India by 1200 years. Chandragupta Maurya of 16th century BCE has been erroneously dated in the 4th century BCE. Moreover, the wrong assumption of the same epoch (78 CE) for the Œaka era (583 BCE) and the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) has brought forward the chronology of various South Indian dynasties by 661 years. Pulakéœin II, the early Chalukya king of Badami flourished in the 1st century BCE but historians erroneously dated him in the 7th century CE. Similarly, the assumption of the same epoch (57 CE) for the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 CE) brought forward the chronology of various North Indian dynasties by 661 years. Bhoja, the most illustrious king of the ParamÀra dynasty, flourished in the 4th century CE but historians mistakenly dated him in 11th century CE. Eminent historians concocted an epoch of a fictitious era in 606 CE and brought forward the Sri Harsha of the 5th century BCE to the 7th INTRODUCTION\n16 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA century CE. The chronology of the Gupta kings and the Kalachuri kings has also been brought forward by more than 650 years due to the erroneous fixing of the epoch of the Gupta era (319 CE instead of 335 BCE) and the Kalachuri-Chedi era (249 CE instead of 403 BCE). The dates of nirvÀõa of Buddha and nirvÀõa of MahÀvÁra have also been brought forward by 1648 years and 661 years respectively. The eminent historians have also robbed off more than 1000 years of the antiquity of the history of ancient Nepal by erroneously identifying the era of the inscriptions of the early LiccÍavi kings to be the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Thus the entire chronology of ancient India was distorted by a section of historians and many theories without any basis have been floated as historical facts in modern textbooks of Indian history. Indian chroniclers should share the blame for these concoctions and distortions as they forgot the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king (583 BCE) and the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). Eminent historians mistakenly identified “Sandrokottus” with Chandragupta Maurya and some dubious scholars fraudulently concocted the theory of the Aryan invasion misleading the entire body of modern Indian historical research in a wrong direction over the last 231 years. Moreover, modern eminent historians lack the knowledge of basic Sanskrit and that adversely affects the quality of Indian historical research. The Govt of India should promote the compulsory teaching of Sanskrit to the students of Indian history to ensure the future of fundamental research in Indian history. Being a student of Sanskrit, I have studied the original text of various inscriptions instead of reading the English translations. Based on the study of the exact epoch of ancient Indian eras and the solar or lunar eclipses mentioned in inscriptions, I have attempted to reconstruct the entire chronology of ancient India in the forthcoming chapters. I request the learned readers to go through the entire book before evaluating this research work. \u0002\n17 The Œaka era was popularly used for dating in the ancient and medieval period inscriptions and texts in India, Cambodia and Java (Indonesia). It is generally accepted that the Œaka era commenced on 3rd March (Chaitra Œukla PratipadÀ) 78 CE. There has been an interesting debate about the origin and originator of the Œaka era among historians particularly from 1890 to 1960. The epoch of Œaka era is a settled issue for a majority of historians now. I dare to re-open the debate. In fact, a divergence of opinion about the origin and originator of the Œaka era exists even today. The issue of the originator will be discussed at the end of this chapter. First, we will discuss about the two theories related to the origin of the Œaka era: ● Only one Œaka era exists and it commenced in 78 CE. ● There are two Œaka eras: The first era originated much before 78 CE and the second era popularly known as “ŒÀlivÀhana Œaka” commenced in 78 CE. JF Fleet and F. Kielhorn propounded the theory that there is only one Œaka era that commenced in 78 CE. A majority of ‘eminent’ Indian historians accepted this as eternal truth. TS Narayana Sastri1 was the first who pointed out the existence of two eras in the name of Œaka. He attempted to prove that the old Œaka era commenced in 550 BCE and that the ŒÀlivÀhana Œaka era originated later in 78 CE. Prof. Gulshan Rai2 and Kota Venkatachelam3 supported the theory of TS Narayana Sastry. V.Thiruvenkatacharya4 proposed that the epoch of Œaka era was in 551 BCE whereas Jagannatha Rao and CV Vaidya believed it was in 543 BCE. K Rangarajan proposed that it was in 523/522 BCE. Though these scholars could not convincingly prove the epoch of the Œaka era, they successfully exposed the weak foundations of the theory of only one Œaka era.",

    "content": "The Epoch of the Œaka Era\n18 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA JF Fleet had collected more than 370 references of the Œaka era from various inscriptions. F. Kielhorn published an article “On the dates of the Œaka Era in inscriptions” in Indian Antiquary, Vol XXIII, May 1894. He verified 370 references to the Œaka era with the presumption of 78 CE as the epoch. He found that the calculation of about 140 dates “satisfy the requirements” whereas that of 70 dates was “unsatisfactory”. He also claimed that the details of more than 30 dates are doubtful and that around 100 dates contain no details for verification. Based on their analysis, JF Fleet and Kielhorn dubbed certain inscriptions as “spurious documents”. Unfortunately, most Indian historians also accepted these inscriptions as ‘spurious’ without any verification. William Jones identified the “Sandrokottus” referred to by ancient Greek historians as Chandragupta Maurya and presented the Indian chronology of the Imperial era from 324 BCE. John Faithful Fleet, F. Kielhorn and other western historians blindly believed the distorted chronology given by Sir William Jones and did not accept any date beyond 324 BCE. These scholars declared some of the inscriptions and texts as “spurious” because details therein did not reconcile with their biased approach to Indian chronology. Surprisingly, Fleet and Kielhorn even alleged that these inscriptions are forgeries though at the same time accepting the information selectively from these sources. In the light of epigraphic and literary data, historians need to correct their theories. Partial acceptance and partial rejection of epigraphic and literary data without any substantial proof should be rejected with contempt. Let us make one more effort to read the ‘spurious’ inscriptions of the Œaka era to ascertain whether these are really spurious epigraphs or whether they run contrary to certain spurious theories. While reading the inscriptions and texts of the Œaka era, we can easily distinguish two different ways of referring to the reckoning of the Œaka era. Some epigraphs unambiguously refer to the epoch of the Œaka era from the coronation of the Œaka king whereas some epigraphs refer to the epoch of the Œaka era from the death of the Œaka king or the end of the Œaka era.\n19 From the coronation of From the death of the Œaka King the Œaka King or the end of the Œaka era Œaka-nÃpati-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsare Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara- œateÈu ŒakavarÈeÈu-atÁteÈu Œaka-varÈÀtÁta-saÚvatsare Œaka-bhÂpa-kÀla, Œakendra-kÀla JÀte ŒakÀbde tataÍ, Œakendre atigate Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀt or ŒakÀnÀm kÀlÀt YÀte kÀle ŒakÀnÀm, Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀkrÀnta-saÚvatsara Svasti Œri ŒÀke Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁteÈu Svasti Œri ŒakavarÈe or Svasti Œri Œakavatsare ŒakÀnÀmapi bhÂbhujÀm gateÈu abdeÈu ŒÀlivÀhana ŒakÀbdam..... neya Œaka-pÃthivÁpateÍ varÈÀõÀm Œri JayÀbhyudaya ŒÀlivÀhana Œake ŒakÀbde Svasti Œri ŒakavarÈam.... neya ŒÀke or ŒÀkeÈu ŒakavariÈam neya Œaka-kÀlÀd-Àrabhya ŒakÀbdÀnÀm pramÀõe ŒakavarÈam neya Any scholar with a basic knowledge of Sanskrit can make the distinction in the meaning of the references segregated above. It is evident that one set of references leads to the coronation of the Œaka king whereas other set of references leads to the end or death of the Œaka king. How can the totally different references “Œaka-nÃpati-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsara” and “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara” lead to the same epoch? Eminent historians must learn some basic Sanskrit to understand the real meaning of these references in epigraphs. Prima facie, it appears that the epigraphs that refer to “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla” denote a different epoch from that in the epigraphs that refer to “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara”. Interestingly, “Œaka”, “ŒakÀbda” and “ŒakavarÈa” became synonymous to “SaÚvat” (meaning era) from the 7th century CE onwards. We must be very careful while dating the epigraphs referring “ŒakavarÈam...... neya” because the same expression was used for both epochs. From the 8th or 9th century CE onwards, the common people ignorant of the two different epochs, started using the expressions interchangeably both for the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king or the epoch of the death of the Œaka king. This created confusion among learned THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n20 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA astronomers too. To eliminate this confusion, the name of “ŒÀlivÀhana” was later attached to distinguish the epoch of the death of the Œaka king from the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king. The reference of “ŒÀlivÀhana” in epigraphs started around 897 CE.5 It is argued that the epoch initially referred to the coronation of the Œaka King and later to the death of the Œaka King. This absurd argument can easily be rejected because the Pimpalner copper plate grant6 of Chalukya SatyÀœrayadeva (Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta 310) refers to the epoch as “Œaka- nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara” whereas the inscription of Chalukya MangalÁœvara (Œaka 500)7 refers to as “Œaka-nÃpati-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsara”. It is proven beyond doubt that MangalÁœvara reigned as king before the Chalukya king of Pimpalner copper plate grant. Interestingly, the majority of the so-called spurious inscriptions refer to “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla” whereas the majority of regular inscriptions refer to “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” or “ŒÀlivÀhana Œaka”. This indicates that the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla” was different from the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara”. The expression “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla + atÁta-saÚvatsara” (from the end of the era of the Œaka king) itself is compelling epigraphic evidence to prove the existence of “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla” (the era of Œaka king) prior to 78 CE. Bhaskaracharya, the author of SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi, clearly mentions the existence of the Œaka era or ŒakÀbda prior to the death of the Œaka king. YÀtÀÍ Èaõmanavo yugÀni bhamitÀnyanyadyugÀôghritrayam, NandÀdrÁnduguõÀstathÀ ŒakanÃpasyÀnte kalervatsarÀÍ | GodrÁndvadrikÃtÀôkadasranagagocandrÀÍ ŒakÀbdÀnvitÀÍ Sarve saÚkalitÀÍ pitÀmahadine syurvartamÀne gatÀÍ || 8 In this verse, BhÀskara states that 3179 years elapsed since the beginning of Kaliyuga till the end or death of the Œaka king and 1972947179 years elapsed from the starting of Kalpa till the death of the Œaka king including the years of ŒakÀbda or Œaka era. The word “ŒakÀbdÀnvitÀÍ” explicitly indicates the existence of the ŒakÀbda or Œaka era prior to 78 CE. Undoubtedly, the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” commenced in the year 78 CE when the Œaka king was killed. Alberuni, a Persian scholar, who visited India between 1017 CE and 1031 CE, wrote:9\n21 “The epoch of the era of Œaka falls 135 years later than that of VikramÀditya. The here-mentioned Œaka tyrannised over their country between the river Sindh and the ocean, after he had made AryÀvarta in the midst of this realm his dwelling place. He interdicted the Hindus from considering and representing themselves as anything but Œakas. ............ The Hindus had much to suffer from him, till at last they received help from the east, when VikramÀditya marched against him, put him to fight and killed him in the region of Karur, between Multan and the castle of Loni. Now this date became famous, as people rejoiced in the news of the death of the tyrant and was used as the epoch of an era, especially by the astronomers. ............ Since, there is a long interval between the era which is called the era of VikramÀditya and the killing of Œaka; we think that VikramÀditya from whom the era has got its name is not identical with that one who killed Œaka.” Thus, Alberuni clearly indicated that the death of the Œaka king is the epoch of the Œaka era that commenced in 78 CE but he had no information about the era of the coronation of the Œaka king because it was not in vogue at that time. The era that commenced with the killing of the Œaka king was also referred to as “ŒÀlivÀhana Œaka” from the 9th century onwards. Thus, 78 CE is the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” era. It can never be the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpati-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsara” i.e. the coronation of the Œaka King. Now the question is what is the epoch of the Œaka era that commenced on the coronation of the Œaka King? To answer this question, we have to study the inscriptions of the Œaka era carefully. The inscriptions of Early Chalukyas of Badami or VÀtÀpi explicitly refer to the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king. The Kurtaketi copper plates of the Early Chalukya King VikramÀditya and the Hyderabad copper plates of the Early Chalukya Pulakeœin II provide unambiguous leads to the year of the coronation of Œaka king. The selected text from the Kurtaketi copper plates of VikramÀditya:10 “Viditamastu sosmÀbhiÍ ba[va] triÚœottara-paðca-œateÈu ŒakavarÈeÈu atÁteÈu, vijayarÀjya-saÚvatsare ÈoçaœavarÈe pravartamÀne, Kiœuvojala-mahÀnagara-vikhyÀta- sthitasya VaiœÀkha- JyeÈÇha-mÀsa-madhyamÀmÀvÀsyÀyÀm bhÀskaradine Rohiõyarkœe THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n22 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA madhyÀhnakÀle VikaramÀdityasya............ mahÀdevatayorubhayoÍ VÃÈabharÀœau tasmin VÃÈabharÀœau SÂryagrahaõa sarvamÀsÁ (SarvagrÀsÁ) bhÂte............ “ While this inscription clearly mentions that the elapsed Œaka years are 530, it has been erroneously read as 532 years assuming “ba triÚœottara” as “dvÀtriÚœottara”. Possibly, “ViditamastvasamÀbhir vas- triÚœottara” was deciphered as “Viditamastu sosmÀbhi ba”. The phrase “sosmÀbhir vaÍ” may have been read as “sosmÀbhi [ba]”. If so, “ba” should not be part of “triÚœottara” because “asmÀbhir vas triÚœottara [asmÀbhiÍ + vaÍ + triÚœottara]” is the correct expression in Sanskrit. Precisely, Walter Elliot and Dr. Burnell considered the date as Œaka 530 but JF Fleet insisted that the real date of the grant was Œaka 532. Unfortunately, the third plate which is now missing probably carried a footnote saying “in Œaka 530, on the eighth day of the sixteenth royal victorious year”.11 The Kurtaketi copper plates provide enough details for verification as “530 years of Œaka era elapsed, in the 16th regnal year of VikramÀditya I, on the occasion of total solar eclipse around noon time, on the occasion of new moon day (amÀvÀsyÀ) between VaiœÀkha and JyeÈÇha months, moon in RohiõÁ nakœatra, sun and moon both in Taurus sign (VÃÈabha RÀœi), the total solar eclipse occurred in Taurus and the day was BhÀskara dina i.e. Sunday.” The selected text from the Hyderabad copper plates of Pulakeœin II: 12 “°tmanaÍ pravardhamÀna–rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsare tritÁye ŒakanÃpati- saÚvatsara-œateÈu catustriÚœatyadhikeÈu paðcasvatÁteÈu BhÀdrapadÀmÀvÀsyÀyÀm SÂrya-grahaõa-nimittam” This inscription also provides details for verification as “534 years of Œaka era elapsed, 3rd regnal year of Pulakeœin II, the occasion of solar eclipse on the new moon day (amÀvÀsyÀ) of BhÀdrapada month”. Now, let us verify the details of these two inscriptions. If the epoch of Œaka era is 78 CE, it follows that 20th April 608 CE (530 years elapsed) or 29th April 610 CE (532 years elapsed) would be the date of the Kurtaketi copper plates and 31st August 612 CE is the date of the Hyderabad copper plates. However, it has been established that a Solar eclipse was not visible anywhere in India on these dates or any date from 608 CE to 612 CE. Therefore, JF Fleet and Kielhorn declared the Kurtaketi inscription\n23 as spurious because the data was contrary to their idea of Indian chronology. Interestingly, they have accepted the elapsed years mentioned in inscriptions as part of the chronology of early Chalukyas. This biased approach of JF Fleet and Kielhorn is nothing but distortion. If JF Fleet and Kielhorn were honest, they ought to have accepted their inability to explain the solar eclipses mentioned in these epigraphs. Instead, in their biased chronology, they floated a distorted theory of palaeography to selectively reject certain epigraphs that were inexplicable as spurious or forgeries, thereby casting shadow on their intellectual integrity. These two inscriptions clearly refer to the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king. Thus, the epoch of the death of the Œaka king i.e. 78 CE is not acceptable. Let us verify the two solar eclipses which occurred in Œaka 531st year and Œaka 535th year in the kingdom of the early Chalukyas. All eclipses must be verified with reference to the longitude and latitude of the locations mentioned in the inscriptions. Western historians generally verified solar eclipses anywhere in India or outside India based merely on calculations. I have based my verification of the date and time of eclipses on the comprehensive data on eclipses from NASA (http://eclipse.gsfc.Nasa.gov). The details given in the Kurtaketi copper plates perfectly match the date 9th May 53 BCE. A total solar eclipse was visible and ended around noon time in the Early Chalukya kingdom on 9th May 53 BCE. The solar eclipse started at 09:04 hrs and ended at 11:45 hrs. The day was the new moon day of VaiœÀkha month (between VaiœÀkha and JyeÈÇha months) and the moon was in RohiõÁ nakœatra. The Sun and Moon were in VÃÈabha rÀœi i.e. The Taurus sign. The day was “BhÀskara dina” meaning Sunday but it cannot be verified with reference to the modern Indian calendar. It depends on the SiddhÀnta of Ahargaõa (for calculating the number of days for a specified date with reference to an original epochal date) considered in the calendar used during those days. The details given in the Hyderabad copper plates also perfectly match the date 21st August 49 BCE. A Solar eclipse was visible in the Early Chalukya kingdom on 21st August 49 BCE starting at 10:42:47 THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n24 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA hrs and ending at 14:19:26 hrs. The day was the new moon day of BhÀdrapada month. Based on these two dates, the year of coronation of the Œaka king can be easily calculated. The epoch of the Œaka coronation era ought to have commenced on Chaitra œukla pratipadÀ of 583 BCE i.e. 19th February 583 BCE. Thus, the 530th year of Œaka’s coronation era was elapsed on 11th March 53 BCE and the 534th year was elapsed on 24th February 49 BCE. Let us now verify the inscriptions of various dynasties that refer the Œaka coronation era with the epoch of 583 BCE without any prejudice to the chronology given in modern texts or ancient texts. Henceforth, any reference to the Œaka era means the epoch that commenced in 583 BCE whereas the ŒÀlivÀhana era means the epoch that commenced in 78 CE. The Early Chalukyas of Badami VÀtÀpi or Badami (in Bagalkot district of KarõÀtaka) was the capital of the early Chalukya dynasty. Ptolemy (140 CE) mentions Badami as “Badiamaioi” indicating that Badami was a place of some importance during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. Pulakeœin I, the founder of the Chalukya Empire in VÀtÀpi, according to the Altem or British Museum copper plates, was the grandson of JayasiÚha and son of RaõarÀga. The Aihole inscription13 also gives a similar lineage of the Chalukyas. Pulakeœin I ruled from Œaka 411 (172 BCE) to Œaka 466 (117 BCE). The selected text from the Altem or British Museum copper plates:14 “Œaka-nÃpÀbdeÈvekÀdaœottareÈu catuœ-œateÈu vyatÁteÈu Vibhava- saÚvatsare pravartamÀne | KÃte ca ye | VaiœÀkhodita-pÂrõa-puõya-divase rÀho (hau) vidhau (vidhor) mandalam œliÈÇe.........” “411 years elapsed in Œaka era, in the Jovian year of Vibhava and on the occasion of lunar eclipse, on full moon day of VaiœÀkha month and moon in ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra”. Considering 583 BCE as the epoch, Œaka 411th year i.e. 173-172 BCE elapsed and 172-171 BCE current, the day of 19th April 172 BCE was the full moon day of VaiœÀkha month and the moon was also in ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra. A penumbral lunar eclipse was visible at Badami starting at\n25 19:44 hrs and ending at 21:32 hrs. If 78 CE had been the epoch, 1st May 489 CE was the full moon day of VaiœÀkha month but no lunar eclipse was visible at Badami nor was the moon in ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra. Pulakeœin I was also known as “Vallabheœvara”. He constructed the fort in Badami in Œaka 465 elapsed as mentioned in a Badami inscription.15 Pulakeœin I had two sons; KÁrtivarman I and MangalÁœvara. Pulakeœin I was succeeded by his elder son KÁrtivarman I. According to Chalukya inscriptions, KÁrtivarman I defeated the rulers of Aôga, Vaôga, Kaliôga, Gaôga, Magadha, Madraka, Kerala, KadaÚba etc. His younger brother MangalÁœvara succeeded him as the ruler of Badami in Œaka 489 (95 BCE). The selected text from the Badami cave inscription of MangalÁœvara:16 “PravardhamÀna-rÀjya-saÚvatsare dvÀdaœe Œaka-nÃpati-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka- saÚvatsareÈu-atikrÀnteÈu paðcasu œateÈu mahÀ-KÀrttika-paurõamÀsyÀm” “500 years elapsed in Œaka coronation era, in the 12th year of reign, on full moon day of KÀrttika month.” The year of 84-83 BCE was the elapsed year of Œaka 500 and 83-82 BCE was the 12th regnal year of MangalÁœvara and 19th October 83 BCE was the full moon day of KÀrttika month and the moon was also in KÃttikÀ nakœatra. MangalÁœvara also conquered RevatÁdvÁpa (near Goa). He conspired to secure the succession for his son but SatyÀœraya-Pulakeœin II, the son of KÁrtivarman I, rebelled and in the ensuing civil war between MangalÁœvara and Pulakeœin II, MangalÁœvara lost his life as stated in the Aihole inscription.16 Due to the civil war, the Chalukya Empire became highly vulnerable. Pulakeœin II had the greater responsibility to re-instate the authority of the Chalukyas in Kuntala (Northern KarõÀtaka) and DakœiõÀpatha. Therefore, he decided to put his older son KokkulIa VikramÀditya on the throne in Œaka 515 (69 BCE) and personally led the army to counter the invasions of neighbouring kings. He conquered “VanavÀsi” the capital of KadaÚbas. He also defeated the Gaôgas of Mysore, LÀtas, Mauryas, MÀlavas and Gurjaras. Pulakeœin II defeated Harsha, the king of UttarÀpatha by Œaka 530 (53 BCE) as stated in the Kurtaketi grant of VikramÀditya; it was the greatest achievement of Pulakeœin II. He also defeated the Pallava king and won more than 100 wars against neighbouring kings between Œaka THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n26 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 515 and Œaka 531 (69-53 BCE) and laid strong foundations to Chalukya Kingdom. He was referred to in the Hyderabad copper plates as “Samara- œata-saÚghaÇÇa-paranÃpati-parÀjayopalabdha-parameœvarÀparanÀmadheyaÍ” which meant that Pulakeœin II achieved the title of “Parameœvara” by defeating other kings in hundred wars. Pulakeœin II took over the reins of Badami in Œaka 532 (52 BCE) from his older son Kokkulla VikramÀditya and appointed him as Viceroy of the LÀta region. BuddhavarasarÀja, the younger brother of Pulakeœin II and the uncle of VikramÀditya, was also placed there to support Kokkulla VikramÀditya. The Sanjan grant of BuddhavarasarÀja17 indicates this clearly. This grant was issued on the occasion of a solar eclipse on the new moon day of PauÈa month but the Œaka year is not mentioned. There was only one solar eclipse which occurred on PauÈa AmÀvÀsya i.e. 5th January 28 BCE between Œaka 515 and Œaka 602 (69 BCE-19 CE). Œaka 515 was the 1st regnal year of Kokkulla VikramÀditya whereas Œaka 602 was the last regnal year of VikramÀditya I. Thus, the date of the Sanjan grant can be conclusively fixed on 5th January 28 BCE. This means Kokkulla VikramÀditya was ruling the LÀta region in Œaka 555 (28 BCE). It can also be construed that the Chalukya rule in Gurjara was established by Œaka 532 (52 BCE) and Kokkulla VikramÀditya was the first ruler of Gujarat branch of Chalukyas. In fact, he was the author of the Kurtaketi grant issued in Œaka 530 elapsed when he was ruling from Badami. VikramÀditya I, the youngest son of Pulakeœin II, ruled between Œaka 577 and Œaka 602 (6 BCE-19 CE). Therefore, VikramÀditya I cannot be the author of the Kurtaketi grant and thus, it follows that VikramÀditya I was the younger brother of Kokkulla VikramÀditya. JF Fleet rejected the Kurtaketi grant as spurious because he could not explain the total solar eclipse in Œaka 530 elapsed and the rule of VikramÀditya between Œaka 515 to Œaka 602. Interestingly, he also attempted to mislead Indologists by overruling Walter Elliot and Dr Burnell about the Œaka year of the Kurtaketi grant. He argued that it was Œaka 532 and not Œaka 530. I suspect that JF Fleet deliberately distorted the Œaka year of the Kurtaketi grant because it provides the strongest epigraphic evidence i.e. total solar eclipse with enough verifiable details.\n27 Pulakeœin II had three younger brothers namely Kubja Vishnuvardhana, BuddhavarasarÀja and DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmÀ. As stated above, BuddhavarasarÀja was supporting Kokkulla VikramÀditya in the Gurjara region. Pulakeœin II appointed Kubja Vishnuvardhana who later founded Eastern Chalukya dynasty at Veôgi as Viceroy of coastal Andhra region. It seems that Pulakeœin II also appointed his brother DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmÀ as Viceroy near BalegrÀma (Belgaum). The Nirpan grant of NÀgavardhana,18 issued by TribhuvanÀœraya NÀgavardhanarÀja, the son of DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmarÀja, clearly tells us about the brother of Pulakeœin II. Pulakeœin II had at least six sons namely Kokkulla VikramÀditya, ChandrÀditya, RaõarÀgavarmÀ, °dityavarmÀ, VikramÀditya I and DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmÀ. JF Fleet declared the Nirpan grant spurious because one of the sons of Pulakeœin II was named DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmÀ. Can the fact that an uncle and nephew have the same name be uncommon, unusual, objectionable or indefensible? JF Fleet deliberately concocted convoluted theories to prove that some Indian inscriptions were spurious or forgeries in order to convince other Indologists that some Indian inscriptions were not genuine and hence, need to be rejected. By selectively rejecting some inscriptions as spurious, JF Fleet succeeded in distorting the chronology of ancient India. It appears that any Indian inscription dated prior to 4th century CE, was pushed to a corner by JF Fleet. The controversy about the chronology of the Gaôga dynasty between B Lewis Rice and JF Fleet is enough to understand the devious mind-set of JF Fleet. Pulakeœin II was ruling in Œaka 557 (26 BCE) as mentioned in the Aihole inscription.19 Œaka 577 (6 BCE) was the first regnal year of VikramÀditya I. The Nerur grant20 and Kochre grant21 of Queen VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ (the wife of ChandrÀditya, the elder brother of VikramÀditya I) were probably issued between Œaka 561 and Œaka 577. The Nerur grant was issued in the 5th regnal year of VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ on the 2nd tithi of the dark fortnight of °œvayuja month and on the occasion of “ViÈuva”. ViÈuva or ViÈuvatkÀla means SÀyana MeÈa SaÚkrÀnti (21st March) or SÀyana TulÀ SaÚkrÀnti (23rd September). Therefore, the Nerur grant was issued on SÀyana TulÀ SaÚkrÀnti, on kÃÈõa-pakœa dvitÁyÀ of °œvayuja corresponding to only one date i.e. 23rd September 18 BCE THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n28 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA between Œaka 561 to Œaka 577. Thus, VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ’s 1st regnal year was Œaka 562 (22-21 BCE). It appears that Pulakeœin II was alive up to Œaka 561 (23-22 BCE). VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ’s grant clearly mentions that VikramÀditya I was the successor of the Chalukya Empire (Sva-vamœajÀm lakœmÁm prÀpya ca parameœvaram nivÀrita-VikramÀdityaÍ). Probably, VikramÀditya I had to encounter internal conflicts for succession as well as invasions from neighbouring kings after the death of Pulakeœin II. It is likely that VikramÀditya I took the responsibility of re-establishing the supremacy of the Chalukyas. He allowed VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ, the wife of his elder brother ChandrÀditya, to take over the reins in VÀtÀpi and he himself led the army to counter aggressive neighbouring kings. VijayabhaÇÇÀrikÀ ruled between Œaka 562 (22-21 BCE) and Œaka 576 (8-7 BCE). VikramÀditya I ascended the throne in Œaka year 577 (6 BCE). The selected text from the Talamanchi (Nellore) plates of VikramÀditya I:22 “Viditamastu vosmÀbhiÍ pravardhamÀna-vijayarÀjya-Èadvatsare ŒrÀvaõamÀsa-SÂryagrahaõe” (In the 6th regnal year and on the occasion of solar eclipse in ŒrÀvaõa month). The Solar eclipse was visible on 31st July 1 BCE in Nellore and the day was the new moon day of ŒrÀvaõa month. Savnur plates23 of Vikramaditya I are dated in Œaka 597 (14 CE). VikramÀditya I was succeeded by his son VinayÀditya in Œaka 602 (18- 19 CE). The selected text from the Sorab (Shimoga) plates of VinayÀditya:24 “[Ca]turddaœottara-ÈaÇccÍateÈu Œaka-varÈeÈu atÁteÈu pravardhamÀna- vijayarÀjya-saÚvatsare ekÀdaœe varttamÀne...........

The elapsed year is 29-30 CE and 30-31 CE is current. DakœiõÀyana SaÚkrÀnti started on 16th June 30 CE and nakœatra was RohiõÁ. The reference to Saturday cannot be verified with reference to the modern Indian calendar. It depends on the SiddhÀnta of Ahargaõa (for calculating number of days for a specified date with reference to an original epochal\n29 date) considered in the calendar used during those days. JF Fleet and Kielhorn declared that this inscription refers to the date with wrong nakœatra because they considered 78 CE as the common epoch of Œaka kÀla era and Œaka kÀlÀtÁta era. The selected text from the Kendur plates of KÁrtivarman II:25 “ViditamevÀstu vosmÀbhiÍ dvisaptatyuttara ÈaÇccÍateÈu ŒakavarÈeÈvatÁteÈu pravardhamÀna-vijayarÀjya-saÚvatsare ÈaÈÇhe varttamÀne...........

VijayÀditya, VikramÀditya II and Kirtivarman II ruled from Œaka 619 (36 CE) to 680 (97 CE).

The date was 21st March 718 CE and Monday. No Lunar eclipse on VaiœÀkha paurõamÀsi of 749 CE, or 750 CE or 751 CE. All verifiable details from the 12 inscriptions above perfectly correspond to the dates in Œaka era (583 BCE) as explained whereas the details of only two inscriptions can be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era (Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era). The strongest epigraphic evidence i.e. one total solar eclipse and two partial Solar eclipses cannot be explained in ŒÀlivÀhana era. Thus, it is evident that the early Chalukyas used Œaka era that commenced in 583 BCE. The text of the following two inscriptions needs to be verified from the original plates to ascertain the actual details of the date because it appears that there are some errors in the transcription. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n32 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 1. Lunar eclipse on the full moon day of JyeÈÇha? (°ÈÀçha) month.38 (Œaka 594 year elapsed & 17th regnal year of VikramÀditya I.) Tembhurni plates of VikramÀditya I, (JESI, Vol 10, 1983) were found in damaged condition. It seems that “JyeÈÇha”month has been assumed with reference to 672 CE. Probably, the month was °ÈÀçha not JyeÈÇha. It needs verification from the original plates. 2. Lunar eclipse on the full moon day of BhÀdrapada or BhÀdrapada nakœatra.39 (Œaka 645 elapsed, 28th regnal year of VijayÀditya.) Actually, Œaka 646 elapsed is the 28th regnal year of Vijayaditya. It needs verification from the original plates. The epoch: 583 BCE (Œaka era) Considering the month as °ÈÀçha, the date was 4th June 11 CE and the total lunar eclipse was visible from 18:52 hrs to 21:00 hrs. A penumbral Lunar eclipse was visible on 27th Aug 63 CE. The epoch: 78 CE (ŒÀlivÀhana era) Considering the month as JyeÈÇha, the date was 17th May 672 CE and the lunar eclipse was visible but the month needs to be verified. Regular in case Œaka 645 elapsed is correct but regnal year cannot be 28th. A total Lunar eclipse was visible on 20th August 723 CE. The chronology of the early Chalukyas given by JF Fleet and his followers consists of many distortions. In fact, JF Fleet appears to be obsessed with his concocted idea that Pulakeœin II and Harshavardhana were contemporaries of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang. According to JF Fleet, Hiuen Tsang visited the court of Ho-li-sha-fa-t’an-ha or Harshavardhana, otherwise called Shi-lo-o’-t’ie-to or SÁlÀditya and apparently visited a capital of the kingdom of Mo-ho-la-ch’a or MahÀraÈÇra, the king of which was named Pu-lo-ki-she or Pulakeœin II.40 Since Hiuen Tsang sojourned in India from 629 CE to 645 CE, JF Fleet argued that the date of defeat of Harshavardhana cannot be earlier than 630 CE. Thus, he distorted the entire chronology of the early Chalukyas by rejecting the Altem plates (Œaka 411), the Kurtaketi plates (Œaka 530) and the Kanadalgaon plates (issued in the 5th regnal year of Pulakeœin II or Œaka 537) as spurious or forgery.\n33 THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA The Kurtaketi and Kanadalgaon plates refer explicitly to the defeat of Harshavardhana that means Pulakeœin II defeated Harshavardhana at prior to Œaka 530 (53 BCE). This date in ŒÀlivÀhana era should be before 608 CE but JF Fleet argued for the date 630 CE. Truly speaking, the idea to link Hiuen Tsang with Pulakisin II and Harshavardhana is not only baseless speculation but also a palpable forgery because Pulakeœin II flourished in the 1st century BCE whereas Harshavardhana lived in the 5th century BCE (Alberuni mention that the Œri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE). We will discuss Harshavardhana and his era in detail in",

    "content": ". In fact, Harsha or Harshavardhana mentioned in the Chalukya inscriptions was Harsha Vikramaditya of Ujjain and not Harshavardhana of PuÈpabhuti dynasty. Pulakeœin II might have defeated Harsha VikramÀditya of Ujjain. Thus, Pulakeœin II and Harsha VikramÀditya lived in the 1st century BCE. Therefore, Hiuen Tsang cannot be their contemporary. Interestingly, another historian James Fergusson speculated that Pulakeœin II was a contemporary of Khusru II of Persia. He referred an Arabic chronicle, which records the fact that in the 36th regnal year of Khusru II of Persia, gifts and letters were exchanged between him and Pulakeœin II.41 He also speculated about a painting in one of Ajanta caves depicting the presentation of a letter from a Persian king to an Indian king, supposedly Pulakeœin II. This is again baseless. Pulakeœin II lived in the 1st century BCE whereas Khusru II belonged to the 7th century CE. It is evident that some of the Western scholars indulged in speculative research without any evidence. The Early Chalukyas of Gujarat Kokkulla VikramÀditya, the elder son of Pulakeœin II, was the founder of the Gujarat branch of the early Chalukyas. He was appointed the Viceroy of Gurjara region around Saka 532 (51 BCE) by his father Pulakeœin II and he was ably supported by BuddhavarasarÀja, his father’s younger brother. Many inscriptions of the early Chalukyas referred to Kalachuri-Chedi era because Kalachuri-Chedi era was popular in this region. It may be noted that Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403-402 BCE; the epoch of this era will be discussed in detail in",

    "content": ".\n34 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA DharÀœraya JayasiÚhavarmÀ, the youngest brother of Kokkulla VikramÀditya, succeeded him. He had three sons namely ŒryÀœraya SÁlÀditya, JayÀœraya VinayÀditya Mangalarasa and AvanijanÀœraya PuõakeœirÀja. The NavasÀri grant of PuõakeœirÀja42 was issued in Kalachuri year 490 (86-87 CE). This establishes that the Gujarat branch of the Chalukyas was ruling right up to 87 CE. The rise of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas ended the rule of the early Chalukyas. It appears that a Chalukya king SatyÀœrayadeva was ruling in the Khandesh region at the end of the 4th Century CE. He was the author of the Pimpalner grant. Interestingly, the Pimpalner grant is the earliest grant to refer to the Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta era or ŒÀlivÀhana era indicating the beginning of the use of the ŒÀlivÀhana era in the 4th century CE. The Pimpalner grant itself is the strongest evidence to reject the modern chronology of the early Chalukyas. The selected text from the Pimpalner Plates of Chalukya SatyÀœrayadeva:43\n35 “Svasti Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œateÈu tri (tri) Èu daœottareÈvasyÀm saÚvatsara-mÀsa-pakœa-divasa-pÂrvyÀyÀm tithau” The date expressed in this inscription as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta- saÚvatsara-œateÈu” indicating the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa- kÀlÀtÁta” (the end of Œaka era) in 78 CE and not the epoch of “Œaka-nÃpa-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka” (the coronation of Œaka king). Earlier, all the inscriptions of the Chalukyas mentioned the date as “Œaka-varÈeÈu-atÁteÈu” explicitly referring to the epoch of 583 BCE. The date given in Pimpalner Plates is ŒÀlivÀhana 310 that corresponds to 388 CE. It seems that the Chalukyas re-instated themselves in Khandesh (Central India) by 388 CE. JF Fleet rejected the Pimpalner grant and called it a “modern forgery” because it was written in late characters. The Pimpalner grant was written in late characters because it belongs to a period that came 300 years after the last inscriptions of the Early Chalukyas. This one instance is evidence enough to expose the shallowness of JF Fleet’s palaeography; he had erected the structure of palaeography based on his distorted and concocted chronology. Actually, Fleet’s distorted palaeography in itself is a “modern forgery”. A palaeography derived from the distorted chronology cannot be accepted as evidence till the fundamental issues in ancient Indian chronology get resolved. Moreover, palaeography can be supporting evidence only for dating inscriptions.

THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n36 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The verifiable epigraphic evidence: The Sanjan plates of BuddhavarasarÀja:44 Solar Eclipse on the new moon day of PauÈa month. Considering the epoch of the Œaka era in 583 BCE, a solar eclipse was visible on 5th January 28 BCE (there was only one solar eclipse occured on PauÈa AmÀvÀsyÀ between Œaka 515 and Œaka 602). The Nasik plates of DharÀœraya JayasiÚha:45 the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month and “ViÈuva” or SÀyana MeÈa SaÚkrÀnti. The date corresponds to 18th March 34 CE (436th year of the Kalachuri-Chedi era i.e. 32-33 CE is current and 33-34 CE is elapsed considering the epoch in 403 BCE). The Pimpalner plates of SatyÀœrayadeva:46 Solar eclipse in ŒÀlivÀhana era 310 elapsed. The year was 388-389 CE considering the epoch in 78 CE. A solar eclipse was visible on 18th Aug 388 CE between 13:30 hrs to 16:20 hrs. It is evident that Western historians and many Indian historians too were ignorant of the different epochs of the Œaka era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Pandit Bhagvanlal Indraji opined that NavasÀri grant of ŒÁlÀditya is a forgery because he could not understand the date of the grant and thought that the name “ŒÁlÀditya” cannot be a Chalukya.47 JF Fleet also declared some grants of the early Chalukyas of Gujarat spurious. Actually, these Indologists were ignorant of the real epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era. Moreover, when VikramÀditya, VinayÀditya and VijayÀditya can be Chalukyas then why not ŒÁlÀditya? I take strong\n37 objection to this tendency to declare certain Indian inscriptions spurious or forgeries without any concrete evidence. It seems preposterous to think that the early Chalukya kings got the weird idea of forging copper plates in anticipation that some wise men from the West will write their history in the 19th and 20th centuries CE !! And it would have been well nigh impossible for a common man of that era to forge copper plates and a royal seal. As it is well established that Indians had a sophisticated knowledge of the lunisolar calendar from the post vedic period, it would be farcical to think that a common man could mislead learned people with spurious dates and eclipses. In all my extensive studies in this area, I have not once encountered a spurious inscription till date while quite a few of the chronologies propounded by Western scholars are ill- founded, unsubstantiated and hence, spurious. Inscriptions of the early Chalukyas prior to Pulakeœin I It is evident from certain inscriptions that JayasiÚha I, the grandfather of Pulakeœin I, was not the earliest king of the Chalukyas. It appears that the Kaira grant of VijayarÀja,48 the Maruturu grant of SatyÀœraya Œri PÃthivÁvallabha,49 the Nerur grant of MangalarÀja,50 the Godachi grant of Katti Arasa51 and the Mudhol grant of Pugavarman52 were issued in periods prior to the reign of JayasiÚha I. Interestingly, all of the above grants except Mudhol grant mention the phrase “SvÀmi- MahÀsena-pÀdÀnudhyÀtÀnÀm”, a common feature in the grants of the KadaÚba Dynasty. Probably, Chalukyas and KadaÚbas shared a common heritage. None of the Badami Chalukya grants from the time of Pulakeœin I mention “SvÀmi-MahÀsena-pÀdÀnudhyÀtÀnÀm” but Veôgi Chalukyas used it occasionally. Historians have erred in identifying the SatyÀœraya of Maruturu grant to be Pulakeœin II, the Katti Arasa of Godachi grant to be KÁrtivarman I, the MangalarÀja of Nerur grant to be MangalÁœvara and the Pugavarman of Mudhol grant to be the son of Pulakeœin I. There is no evidence to prove them as such. Unfortunately, these inscriptions are not dated. Only the Kaira grant of VijayarÀja mentions a date in unknown era as “|SaÚvatsara| 394 |VaiœÀkha œu 15 |”. Thus, Kaira grant was issued on full moon day of Vaishkha month in the year 394. Kaira grant also tells us that VijayarÀja was the son of BudhavarmÀ and the grandson of JayasiÚha. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n38 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA It is certain that the date of the Kaira grant was not recorded in the Œaka era. In my opinion, the Kaira grant probably refers to the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE), also known as “KÃta era” and “MÀlava-gaõa era”. Western historians concocted the theory that the KÃta, MÀlava- gaõa and Vikrama eras have the same epoch that commenced in 57 BCE. However, the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama or KÃta or Malava-gaõa era commenced in 719-718 BCE. Thus, the Kaira grant was probably issued in 326-325 BCE. In",

    "content": ", we will discuss the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama or KÃta or MÀlava-gaõa eras in detail. A comprehensive list of important inscriptions of the early Chalukyas of Badami is provided in Appendix I. The Eastern Chalukyas of Veôgi Vishnuvardhana I (Kubja Vishnuvardhana) was the founder of the Eastern Chalukya Dynasty. He was the younger brother of early Chalukya king Pulakeœin II who established the strongest empire of the Chalukyas between the NarmadÀ and KÀveri rivers. Pulakeœin II extended his territory towards east from ViœÀkhapaÇnam to Nellore. He appointed his brother Vishnuvardhana I as Viceroy in the coastal Andhra region. In a short period, Vishnuvardhana I became independent and established his capital at Veôgi and ruled for 18 years. Most of the inscriptions of the Eastern Chalukyas relate the history of their dynasty. As some inscriptions mention the tenure of the kings reigned, we can easily reconcile the chronology of Eastern Chalukyas based on the verifiable epigraphic evidence. Let us, therefore, verify the dates given in the inscriptions of the Eastern Chalukyas. The copper plates of Amma RÀja II mention the date of his coronation. The selected text of the copper plates of Amma RÀja II:53 “Giri-rasa-vasu sankhyÀbde Œaka-samaye MÀrgaœÁrÈa-mÀse’smin kÃÈõa- trayodaœadine bhÃguvÀre Maitra-nakœatre. DhanuÈi ravau GhÀta-lagne dvÀdaœavarÈe tu janmataÍ paÇam (ÇÇam)” The Eastern Chalukya King Amma RÀja II was coronated when he was 12 years old, in the year of Œaka 867, on the 13th tithi of the dark fortnight of MÀrgaœÁrÈa month. The moon was also in Maitra (AnurÀdhÀ) nakœatra and Sun was in Dhanu sign. Lagna was GhÀta and the day was bhÃguvÀra i.e. Friday.\n39 Considering the epoch of the Œaka era in 583 BCE, 283-284 CE was 867th year of Œaka. 4th December 283 CE was the date of the coronation of Amma II. It was kÃÈõa trayodaœÁ of the MÀrgaœÁrÈa month and the moon was also in AnurÀdhÀ (Maitra) nakœatra. The lagna was GhÀta and Sun was in Dhanu rÀœi. BhÃguvÀra or Friday cannot be verified without ascertaining the SiddhÀnta of Ahargaõa considered in the calendar of those days. Considering the epoch in 78 CE, 944-945 CE was the current. 16th December 944 CE was the 13th tithi of the dark fortnight of MÀrgaœÁrÈa month but the moon was in JyeÈÇha nakœatra. Therefore, Kielhorn considered 867th year as elapsed and fixed the date in 868th year of Œaka. The date of 5th December 945 CE meets the requirements but Lagna was not GhÀta. However, the inscription unambiguously mentions that 867th year is current. The selected text from the copper plates of RÀjarÀja I:54 “Yo rakœitum vasumatÁm ŒakavatsareÈu, VedÀmburÀœi-nidhi varttiÈu SiÚhage’rke | KÃÈõa-dvitÁya-divasottarabhadrikÀyÀm, VÀre guror vaõiji lagna-vare’bhiÈiktaÍ || ” Eastern Chalukya King RÀjarÀja I was coronated in the year of Œaka 944 on 2nd tithi of the kÃÈõa pakœa. Sun was in SiÚha rÀœi and Moon was in UttarabhadrÀ nakœatra. Considering the epoch in 583 BCE, 360-361 CE is 944th year of Œaka. The word “varttiÈu” clearly indicates that 944 is the current year. Thus, 15th August 360 CE was the 2nd tithi of the kÃÈõa pakœa of BhÀdrapada month, the moon in UttarabhadrÀ nakœatra and the Sun in SiÚha rÀœi. Considering the epoch in 78 CE, 1021-1022 CE is 944th year. The date is 28th July 1021 CE and corresponds to the 2nd tithi of kÃÈõa pakœa of BhÀdrapada month but the moon was in ŒatabhiÈaj nakœatra and not in UttarabhadrÀ. Therefore, the epoch of 78 CE cannot explain the date of the coronation of RÀjarÀja II. The selected text from the Chittoor copper plates of Kulottuôga Choçadeva II:55 THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n40 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “ŒakÀbdÀnÀm pramÀõe rasa-viœikha-viyaccandra-sankhyÀm prayÀte deœe ............. °rdrarkœe pÂrvapakœe viÈuvati sutithau ............” (In Œaka era, 1056 years elapsed, saÚkrÀnti in °rdra nakœatra and in pÂrvapakœa i.e. œuklapakœa.) Considering the epoch in 583 BCE, 472-473 CE was elapsed and 473-474 CE was current. Makara saÚkrÀnti took place on 19th December 473 CE. It was the 14th tithi of œukla pakœa in the month of PauÈa and the nakœatra was °rdra. Considering the epoch in 78 CE, 1133-1134 CE was elapsed and 1134- 1135 CE was current but none of the saÚkrÀnti took place in °rdra nakœatra. The selected text from the copper plates of Vishnuvardhana III:56 “°tmano Vijaya-paðcame saÚvatsare PhÀlguna-mÀse amÀvÀsyÀyÀm SÂryagrahaõa- nimittam” (On the occasion of solar eclipse, on the new moon day of PhÀlguna month and 5th regnal year of Vishnuvardhana III). Vishnuvardhana III ruled for 37 years between 49 CE to 86 CE. 5th regnal year was 53 CE. The Solar eclipse was visible on 9th Mar 53 CE in the morning between 6:34 hrs to 6:49 hrs and the day was the new moon day of PhÀlguna month. The selected text from the ChÁpurupalle copper plates of Vishnuvardhana I:57 “Satyaœraya-Œrivallabha-MahÀrÀjaÍ | Tasya priyÀnujaÍ.......... Œri Vishnuvardhana MahÀrÀjaÍ.......... ŒrÀvaõa mÀse Candragrahaõa\n41 nimitte.......... SaÚ 10 8 ma 4 di 10 5 |” (Lunar eclipse on the full moon day of ŒrÀvaõa month and in 18th regnal year of Vishnuvardhana I.) Vishnuvardhana I ruled for 18 years between 46 BCE to 29 BCE. A Lunar eclipse was visible on 26th July 29 BCE between 18:54 hrs to 19:49 hrs and the day was the full moon day of ŒrÀvaõa month. The chronology of the Eastern Chalukyas: SatÀrÀ grant58 of Vishnuvardhana I dated in the 8th regnal year of MahÀrÀja or Pulakeœin II gives the title of “YuvarÀja” to Vishnuvardhana I. Hyderabad plates are dated in the 3rd regnal year of Pulakeœin II which was 535th year of Œaka. Thus, Œaka 540 was the 8th regnal year. Chipurupalle plates mention the lunar eclipse on the full moon day of ŒrÀvaõa month in the 18th regnal year of Vishnuvardhana I. Considering that the lunar eclipse occurred on 26th July 29 BCE, 46-45 BCE was the 1st regnal year and 29-28 BCE was the 18th regnal year of Vishnuvardhana I. Based on the coronation date of Amma RÀja II in Œaka 867 (4th Dec 283 CE), the date of the coronation of RÀjarÀja I in Œaka 944 (15th Aug 360 CE) and the date of the copper plate grant of Kulottuôga Choçadeva II in Œaka 1056 elapsed (19th Dec 473 CE), the chronology of Eastern Chalukya Dynasty can be reconstructed as shown below: Duration Œaka era In CE Chronology (583 BCE) given by JF Fleet59 Vishnuvardhana I (Brother of SatyÀœraya Pulakeœin II) 18 years 538-555 46-29 BCE 615-633 CE JayasiÚha (Brother of Kubja Vishnuvardhana) 30 years 555-584 28 BCE - 2 CE 633-663 CE IndrarÀja 7 days 2 CE 663 CE Vishnuvardhana II (elder son of IndrarÀja brother of JayasiÚha) 9 years 585-593 3 - 11 CE 663-672 CE Maôgi YuvarÀja (son of Vishnuvardhana II) 25 Years 594-619 11 - 36 CE 672-696 CE JayasiÚha II (Son of Maôgi YuvarÀja) 13 Years 619-631 36 - 48 CE 696-709 CE Kokkili (JayasiÚha’s brother, the son of his step mother) 6 Months 49 CE 709 CE THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n42 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Vishnuvardhana III also named as Vishnu RÀja (Elder brother of Kokkili and younger Son of Indra BhaÇÇÀraka) 37 Years 632-669 49 - 86 CE 709-746 CE VijayÀditya BhaÇÇÀraka (Son of Vishnuvardhana III) 18 Years 670-687 87 - 104 CE 746-764 CE Vishnu RÀja or Vishnuvardhana IV 36 Years 688-723 105 - 140 CE 764-799 CE VijayÀditya Narendra MrigarÀja 40 Years 724-763 141 - 180 CE 799-843 CE Kali Vishnuvardhana 1 year & 763-764 180 - 181 CE 843-844 CE 6 months GuõagÀôkaVijayÀditya 44 Years 765-809 182 - 226 CE 844-888 CE Chalukya BhÁma I (DrohÀrjuna) 30 Years 810-839 227 - 256 CE 888-918 CE Kollabigaôda VijayÀditya 6 Months 256 CE 918 CE Amma RÀja I Vishnuvardhana SarvalokÀœraya 7 Years 840-846 257 - 263 CE 918-925 CE Taçapa 1 Month 264 CE 925 CE VikramÀditya (Son of Chalukya BhÁma I) 11 Months 264 CE 926-927 CE Yuddhamalla (Son of Taçapa) 7 Years 848-855 265 - 272 CE 927-934 CE BhÁma II (Brother of Amma RÀja I) 12 Years 855-867 272 - 283 CE 934-945 CE Amma RÀja II VijayÀditya (Son of BhÁma II ) 25 Years 867-892 283 - 309 CE 945-970 CE IndrarÀja 7 days 309 CE 970 CE DÀnÀrõava (Son of BhÁma II & Aôkidevi and half-brother of Amma RÀja II) 3 years 893-896 310-312 CE 970-973 CE Baçapa and his brother Tala II — 312 CE — Dark period (No King) 27 years 897-923 313-340 CE 973-1003 CE Œaktivarman or Chalukya Candra (son of DÀnÀrõava) 12 years 924-936 341-353 CE 1003-1015 CE VimalÀditya (Brother of Œaktivarman) VimalÀditya married RÀjendra Choça’s sister KuôçavamahÀdevi 7 years 936-944 353-360 CE 1015-1022 CE\n43 RÀjarÀja I (son of VimalÀditya) 41 years 944-985 360-401 CE 1022-1063 CE Kulottuôga Choçadeva I (Son of RÀjarÀia I) 49 years 985-1033 401-450 CE 1063-1112 CE VÁra Choça (son of Kullottuôga Choçadeva I) 31 years 1001-1033 417-450 CE — Vikrama Choça (Son of Kulottuôga Choçadeva I) 15 years 1033-1048 450-465 CE 1112-1127 CE Kulottuôga Choçadeva II 1048-1056 465-473 CE 1127 CE to .... (Son of Vikrama Choça) JayasiÚha ruled for 30 or 33 years and VijayÀditya Narendra MrigarÀja for a probable 8 or 4 years as “YuvarÀja” and 40 years as “MahÀrÀja”. Thus, I have considered 30 years for JayasiÚha and 40 years for Narendra MrigarÀja that reconciles with the date of the coronation of Amma RÀja II. Probably, Kulottuôga Choçadeva II was the last eastern Chalukya ruler of Veôgi. The Pithapuram pillar inscription of Malladeva60 tells us that King Malladeva, the descendant of the eastern Chalukya dynasty, was coronated in Pithapuri on the 10th tithi of the dark fornight of Jyeshtha month, when moon was in AœvinÁ nakœatra in Œaka 1124 (541 CE). Considering the epoch in 583 BCE, 540-541 CE is elapsed and 541- 542 CE was current, the date corresponds to 5th June 541 CE.

The year 283-284 CE was 867th year of Œaka. The date 4th Dec 283 CE meets all requirements. Lagna was also GhÀta. The epoch: 78 CE (Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era) No lunar eclipse in 632 CE (18th regnal year). 944-945 CE was 867th year but we have to consider 867 Œaka as elapsed year and 868 as current. Then, 5th December 945 CE meets the requirements but lagna was not GhÀta.\n44 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 3. RÀjarÀja I was coronated in the year of 944 Œaka on 2nd day of KÃÈõa pakœa.

Vishnuvardhana II was the elder and Vishnuvardhana III was the younger.) The year 360-361 CE was 944th year of Œaka. The date 15th August 360 CE meets all requirements. The year 417-418 CE was Œaka 1001. The date was 11th August 417 CE. 472-473 CE elapsed and 473-474 CE is current. Makara saÚkrÀnti took place on 19th December 473 CE. It was 14th day of œukla pakœa and the nakœatra was °rdra. The date is 20th March 4 CE. Vishnuvardhana III ruled for 37 years between 49 CE to 86 CE. 5th regnal year was 53-54 CE. A solar eclipse was visible on 9th Mar 53 CE in the morning between 6:34 hrs to 6:49 hrs 1021-1022 CE was 944th year. 28th July 1021 CE meets the requirements but the nakœatra was ŒatabhiÈaj not UttarabhadrÀ. The date cannot be explained in the year of 1078-1079 CE. 1133-1134 CE elapsed and 1134-1135 CE is current. No saÚkrÀnti took place in °rdra nakœatra. In 664 CE, Chaitra daœamÁ was a kœaya tithi. Solar eclipse in the tenure of Vishnuvardhana II cannot be explained. It was only possible in 6th regnal year of Vishnuvardhana III. It is evident that the inscriptions of the Eastern Chalukyas referred only to the Œaka era (583 BCE) and not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). The chronology of the Eastern Chalukyas in ŒÀlivÀhana era cannot explain most of the epigraphic details. A comprehensive list of important inscriptions of Eastern Chalukyas is provided in Appendix II. The grant of AmmarÀja I68 and subsequent grants tell us that Narendra MrigarÀja (141-180 CE) fought a hundred and eight battles with the forces of the RaÇÇas (RÀÈÇrakÂÇas) and Gaôgas. These grants\n45 also tell us that GuõagÀôka VijayÀditya (182-226 CE), at the instigation of the king of RaÇÇas, killed the king of Noçamba-rÀÈÇra in a great battle of Maôgi and also defeated the Gaôgas who took refuge on the peak of GaôgakÂÇa. He terrorised Krishna (RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AkÀlavarÈa KrishnarÀja II) and burnt his city. He also terrorised Saôkila, the king of ÷ahÀla (Probably, a king of Chedi dynasty), who was joined by the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king Vallabha. Later, the province of Veôgi was overrun by the new RaÇÇa claimants but it appears that Chalukya BhÁma I (227-256 CE) re-established the authority of the Eastern Chalukyas. The Maôgallu grant of Amma RÀja II69 says that Amma RÀja’s half- brother, DÀnÀrõava, the son of Aôkidevi, had taken over the country from the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king Vallabha and ruled the kingdom according to the principles of Manu (“Tasya dvaimÀturaÍ kœmÀm Œakala-jana-mude VallabhÀdÀpta-rÀjyo Bhaimo DÀnÀrõaveœopyavati Manu-nayÀd Aôkidevi- tanÂjaÍ”). The grant also states that, after ruling for eleven years, Amma RÀja II proceeded to the Kaliôga country in wrath against Krishna (“DharitrÁm Rakœan ekÀdaœÀbdam jitaripu-ragamat KÃÈõa-kopÀt Kaliôgam”). The “Krishna” mentioned here is probably the Chedi king of Tripuri who also ruled over Magadha and Kaliôga (as mentioned in Sudi plates of the Ganga king Butuga II). He cannot be a RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king because RÀÈÇrakÂÇas never ruled over Kaliôga. Interestingly, the Eastern Chalukya kingdom gradually became a part of the Choça kingdom during the 4th century CE and slipped into its deepest internal crisis during the reign of DÀnÀrõava. JaÇÀ Choça BhÁma, the brother-in-law of Amma RÀja II, killed DÀnÀrõava. Consequently, the succession struggle between the sons of DÀnÀrõava and JaÇÀ Choça BhÁma was prolonged for 27 years. VimalÀditya, the younger brother of Œaktivarman and the son of DÀnÀrõava, took refuge in the court of RÀjarÀja Choça. RÀjarÀja invaded Veôgi and killed JaÇÀ Choça BhÁma. RÀjarÀja ensured that Veôgi was part of Choça or Chola Kingdom and appointed Œaktivarman as the King of Veôgi under his control. He also married off his daughter KuôdavamahÀdevi to VimalÀditya, the younger brother of Œaktivarman. RÀjarÀja also ensured that his grandson RÀjarÀja II, the son of KuôdavamahÀdevi and VimalÀditya, took over the reins of Veôgi. Thus, THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n46 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the successors of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom became more Choças than Chalukyas and gradually, the territory of Veôgi was absorbed by the Choça Empire. By this period, the Western Chalukyas re-established themselves in Northern KarõÀtaka by overthrowing the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. They were outraged by the absorption of Veôgi into the Choça Empire. Veôgi became a bone of contention resulting in repeated conflicts between the Choças and the Western Chalukyas. It is evident that RÀjarÀja was a contemporary of DÀnÀrõava, Œaktivarman and VimalÀditya. The inscriptions of RÀjendra Choça, the son of RÀjarÀja Choça refer to the Œaka era. The selected text from the stone inscription at BÀõeœvara Temple at Belaturu:70 “Œaka variÈa tombhaynÂra-nalvatta-mÂra (943) neya variÈada Raudra saÚvatsarada °ÈÀçha-mÀsada punnave UttarÀÈÀçha-nakœtram Makara- chandram brihaspativaram .......... Œri-Mudigoôça RÀjendra Cholam” (Œaka year 943, “Raudra” (Jovian) year, the full moon day of °ÈÀçha month, UttarÀÈÀçha nakœatra, Moon in Makara (Capricorn) and Thursday.) The date corresponds to 27th June 359 CE. However, the weekday was Sunday. Kielhorn calculated the date as 7th July 1020 CE in ŒÀlivÀhana era but °ÈÀçha was an intercalary month in 1020 CE. Intercalary months are considered inauspicious especially in South India. Inscriptions generally mention the prefix “Prathama” or “DvitÁya” for an Intercalary month. Thus, it would be irrational to think that RÀjendra Choça performed a special “PÂjÀ” in BÀõeœvara temple in an intercalary month and erected the pillar inscription. Apparently, the date intended here is in the Œaka era and not in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Kielhorn quotes one more inscription of RÀjendra Choça at the same temple.71 “Svasti Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œatamga 955 neya Œrimukha saÚvatsarada MÀrgaœÁrÈa-œuddha-paçivam MÂlarkkadamdu” This inscription unambiguously refers to Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta era which is the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Thus, the RÀjendra Choças mentioned in these two inscriptions are two different personalities from different eras.\n47 Actually, it is easy to identify the Œaka or ŒÀlivÀhana eras from Sanskrit inscriptions because the Sanskrit references are generally unambiguous. Interestingly, Kannada inscriptions say “Œaka variÈam.......... neya” and Telugu inscriptions say “ŒakavarÈambulu” for both eras. Therefore, we have to study the Kannada and Telugu inscriptions carefully to ascertain the actual era intended. Sometimes, the date can be explained satisfactorily in both eras. In such cases, we need to depend upon supporting evidence to draw any conclusions about the chronology. The origin of the Chalukyas and the Early Chalukyas of RÀjamahendravaram The grant of VÁra Choça72 contains valuable information about the origin of the Chalukyas. At the outset, it gives the genealogy of Soma Vamœa (Lunar dynasty) from Atri Muni to PÀndavas and Arjuna to Udayana. Starting from King Udayana, total 59 kings ruled over AyodhyÀ. VijayÀditya was the 60th king of AyodhyÀ. He went on to conquer “DakœiõÀpatha” and attacked Trilochana Pallava but unfortunately got killed in the battle. His queen, who was pregnant (ÈaõmÀsagarbhiõÁ), reached an “agrahÀra” called Muçivemu along with the family-priest and the old ministers. ViÈõubhaÇÇa-somayÀjin protected her like a daughter and she gave birth to a son, Vishnuvardhana. After coming of age, Vishnuvardhana founded a kingdom in DakœiõÀpatha. Thus, Vishnuvardhana founded the rule of Chalukya dynasty. Two grants of the Early Chalukyas who ruled at RÀjamahendravaram are available today. These grants are dated in the Kaliyuga era. One grant available at the Govt Museum of Hyderabad73 is unambiguously dated in Kali year 2628 elapsed (474-473 BCE). It was issued by King Vishnuvardhana II, the grandson of King Vishnuvardhana I. Historians have identified this grant with Vishnuvardhana I or Vishnuvardhana II of the Eastern Chalukyas and assumed that the Kali year given is incorrect. However, there should be no doubt that these grants belong to the Early Chalukyas who ruled at RÀjamahendravaram, much before the establishment of the Eastern Chalukya kingdom at Veôgi. It appears that the Chalukyas were attempting to establish a kingdom in DakœiõÀpatha from the beginning of the 6th century BCE till the end of the 3rd century BCE. I have also THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n48 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA referred to five more grants of the Early Chalukyas in the context of the early Chalukyas of Badami which may also belong to this period. JayasiÚha I or Vishnuvardhana, who married the daughter of a Pallava king, established a strong Chalukya kingdom between the NarmadÀ and Setu by defeating the KadaÚba and Gaôga kings. His grandson, Pulakeœin I made Badami or VÀtÀpi as the capital city of the Chalukya Empire. The Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas The RÀÈÇrakÂÇas were the descendants of RaÈÇrikas or RaÇhikas mentioned in the edicts of Aœoka. According to a Tamil chronicle namely “Koôgu-deœa-rÀjakkal”, seven RaÇÇa kings ruled over the Koôgu region. The UôdikavÀÇikÀ grant of Abhimanyu74 is the earliest available copper plate inscription of early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. The emblem of this grant bears a SiÚha (lion). MÀnÀôka was the founder of the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇa dynasty of MÀnapura (later MÀnyakheÇa or Malkhed). The Hiôgni Berdi plates of VibhurÀja75 and the Paôçuraôga-palli grant of Avidheya76 also belong to the same lineage of RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. Avidheya also claimed to be ruling over Kuntala (Northern KarõÀtaka). Unfortunately, these inscriptions are dated either in the regnal years or undated. The genealogy of the Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas: The Nagardhan plates of SwamirÀja77 and the Tiwarkheda plates of NannarÀja78 indicate that the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas of Achalapura ruled over the region of Vidarbha around Œaka 553(30 BCE). It appears that the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas shifted their base to Vidarbha following the establishment of the Chalukya kingdom in Northern KarõÀtaka. Thus, the date of MÀnÀôka (250 BCE) DevarÀja (230 BCE) (wife SyÀvalÀôgi MahÀdevi) VibhurÀja MÀnarÀja Avidheeya BhaviÈya (215 BCE) (215 BCE) Abhimanyu (200 BCE)\n49 MÀnÀôka, DevarÀja and Abhimanyu must be fixed as being prior to Chalukya Pulakeœin I (172 BCE). The Nagardhan, Tiwarkheda and Multai plates79 provide the genealogy of the Achalapura branch of the Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇa dynasty. DurgarÀja GovindarÀja SwamikarÀja SwamirÀja NannarÀja NandarÀja The chronology of the Achalapura branch of the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE DurgarÀja 500-515? 83-68 BCE? GovindarÀja 515-530? 68-53 BCE? SwamikarÀja 530-550? 53-33 BCE? SwamirÀja 550-573 33-10 BCE NannarÀja 553-615 30 BCE – 32 CE NandarÀja YuddhÀsura 615-632 32 – 49 CE The Main Branch of Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas GovindarÀja was the earliest king of this branch and was succeeded by his son, KarkarÀja. The Bhindon grant of the feudatory of KarkarÀja80 tells us that KarkarÀja was also called “PratÀpasÁla”. IndrarÀja was the son of KarkarÀja. IndrarÀja defeated the Western Chalukya king and married his daughter.81 Dantidurga, the Son of IndrarÀja, was the first founder of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Empire. He built the DaœÀvatÀra temple at his capital ElÀpura (Ellora). He defeated the Chalukya king Vallabha i.e. KÁrtivarman II, the kings of KÀðchi (Pallava), Kerala, Chola, PÀôçya, Œri Harsha, VajraÇa and KarõÀÇaka between Œaka 671-675 (88-92 CE) [KÀðchiœa-KeralanarÀdhipa-Chola-PÀôçya-Œri-Harsha-VajraÇa-vibheda- vidhÀna- dakœam, KarõÀÇakam].82 He defeated the kings of the Gurjara dynasty in Ujjain and made them his “PratÁhÀra” or door keepers. He also extended his empire up to the Konkan region. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n50 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Three copper plate grants of Dantidurga: The Ellora Plates:83 Œaka 663 current, °œvayuja month, Œuddha trayodaœÁ, SomavÀra (Monday). The date corresponds to 27th Sep 79 CE. The Manor Plates:84 Œaka 671 current i.e. 88 CE. No details for verification. The Samangad Plates:85 Œaka 675 elapsed, MÀgha month, RathasaptamÁ (7th day in bright fortnight). The date corresponds to 24th Dec 92 CE. After the untimely death of Dantidurga, KrishnarÀja or Krishna I, the son of KarkarÀja and the uncle of Dantidurga, took over the reins. KrishnarÀja constructed the famous KailÀsa temple at Ellora. He annexed the kingdom of the early Chalukyas and Manna-nagara (MÀnapura) from the Gaôgas.86 His son GovindarÀja II was appointed as YuvarÀja in Œaka 692 (109 CE).87 Govinda II subjugated the Eastern Chalukya king of Veôgi VishnurÀja or Vishnuvardhana IV. He and the Pallava king NandivarmÀ also played a role in the coronation of Gaôga King ŒivamÀra II. The Copper plate grants of KrishnarÀja I & GovindarÀja II: The Manne Plates of KrishnarÀja I:88 Œaka 680 current, “Hemalamba” saÚvatsara, new moon day of °œvayuja and solar eclipse. Probably, the day was 3rd September 99 CE. The Saka year needs to be verified from original text (Œaka 680? or 682?). The Barsi Plates of KrishnarÀja I:89 Œaka 687 current (103-104 CE), “ŒubhakÃt” saÚvatsara, new moon day of JyeÈÇha month and solar eclipse. The date corresponds to 22nd June 103 CE.\n51 The Talegaon plates of KrishnarÀja I:90 Œaka 690 current (106-107 CE), “Plavaôga” saÚvatsara, new moon day of VaiœÀkha month and solar eclipse. VaiœÀkha amÀvÀsyÀ occurred on 21st Apr 106 CE and a solar eclipse was visible between 16:56 hrs and 18:28 hrs. The Alas Plates of Govindaraja II:91 Œaka 692 current, “Saumya” œamvatsara, °ÈÀçha œuklapakœa saptami. The date corresponds to 3rd June 108 CE. Govinda II also known as “Vallabha”, was referred to as “Jagattuôga- PrabhÂtavarÈa-PratÀpÀvaloka-Œrivallabha”. The Pimpri plates of DhÀrÀvarÈa-Dhruvadeva92 clearly mention that GovindarÀja was called “Vallabha” (VallabhÀkhyaÍ...... ŒrigovindarÀjo). The RÀÈÇrakÂÇa kings were in general called as “Vallabha”. In the concluding Praœasti of a Jaina PurÀõa “HarivaÚœa”, Jinasena states, “ŒÀkeÈvabdaœateÈu SaptaÈu diœam paðcottareÈÂttarÀm, PÀtÁndrÀyudhanÀmni KÃÈõanÃpaje Œrivallabhe dakœiõÀm | PÂrvÀm Œrimadavanti-bhÂbÃti nÃpe vatsÀdhirÀje’param, ŒauryÀnÀmadhimandale Jayayute vire varÀhe’vati || ”93 “During the Œaka year 705 (121-122 CE), Œrivallabha (GovindarÀja or his brother DhruvarÀja) ruled in the South, IndrÀyudha in the North, VatsarÀja of Avanti in the East and VarÀha or JayavarÀha of Œaurya territory (SaurÀÈÇra) was ruling in the West.” These directions are given with reference to VardhamÀnapura (ŒripÀrœvÀlaya-NannarÀja-vasatau), probably Wadhwan in JhÀlÀvad division of KÀÇhiÀwÀd. Only one inscription of PratÁhÀra VatsarÀja that was issued in Œaka kÀla 717 elapsed (134-135 CE), is available. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n52 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Muni-œaœi-naga-saÚsthe yÀti kÀle ŒakÀnÀm | Surabhi-carama mÀse œukla-pakœe daœamyÀm || 94 The date referred to is the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Surabhi- carama (last month of Vasanta ritu i.e. VaiœÀkha) month in Œaka year 717 elapsed corresponding to 21st April 134 CE. This inscription mentions the victories of VatsarÀja over the KarõÀta, LÀÇa rulers, JayÀpÁda of Kashmir and the king of Gauda (avajitÀœeÈa-KarõÀÇa-LÀÇair bhaôgtvÀ dikœu kœatÀrir-jjaya-janita-JayÀpÁda-pÁdasya yasya). The JayÀpÁda mentioned in this inscription was Chippata JayÀpÁda who ruled over Kashmir around 102-114 CE. KuvalayamÀla of Uddyotana SÂri95 was composed in Œaka 700 (116-117 CE) at JÀvÀlipura (Jalor) during the reign of VatsarÀja. Thus, VatsarÀja was a contemporary of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Govinda II and DhÀrÀvarÈa Dhruva. The reference of Œaka-kÀla in the inscription of VatsarÀja indicates the epoch of the Œaka coronation era (583 BCE) and not the epoch of Œaka KÀlÀtÁta era (78 CE). It is evident that VatsarÀja ruled at Avanti in the beginning of the 2nd century when the Œaka era was still in vogue. It appears that NÀgabhaÇa II shifted his capital from Avanti to KÀnyakubja and used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) in his inscriptions. DhÀrÀvarÈa Dhruva, the second son of KrishnarÀja and the younger brother of Govinda II, succeeded his elder brother around Œaka 700-706 (117-123 CE). It may be noted that the Pimpri grant of DhÀrÀvarÈa DhruvarÀja was issued in ŒÀlivÀhana 697 (775 CE) [Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta- saÚvatsara-œata-ÈaÇke sapta-navatyadhike....]. Interestingly, the DhruvarÀja of the Pimpri grant himself tells us about his ancestor DhruvarÀja. “TasyÀnujaÍ Sri-DhruvarÀja-nÀmÀ mahÀnubhÀvo-vihata-pratÀpaÍ prasÀdhitÀ’œeÈa-narendra-cakraÍ krameõa vÀlÀrka-vapur-babhÂva |”96 The verb “babhÂva” is used only in the narration of events that took place in the remote past and certainly would not have ben used for the reigning king DhruvarÀja. Therefore, it is evident that DhruvarÀja II of the Pimpri grant refers to his ancestor DhruvarÀja I. Thus, the reign of DhruvarÀja, the younger brother of GovindarÀja, flourished in 2nd century CE whereas DhruvarÀja II of the Pimpri grant ruled in 8th century CE.\n53 It appears that DhruvarÀja I was coronated by the ministers around Œaka 700-706 (117-123 CE) as GovindarÀja became increasingly addicted to women and shirked his responsibilities. Dhruva, who was also called “Nirupama”, imprisoned the powerful Gaôga king (ŒivamÀra II) and defeated VatsarÀja who attempted to seize the Gauda (Bengal) kingdom.97 DhÀrÀvarÈa’s son Govinda III, who ascended the throne as YuvarÀja around Œaka 720 (137 CE), ensured the release of the imprisoned Gaôga King (ŒivamÀra II). Three copper plate grants of Govinda III: The Manne plates:98 Œaka 724 (140-141 CE), Lunar eclipse and PuÈya nakœatra. Total Lunar eclipse was visible on 11th Dec 140 CE from 19:57 hrs to 1:22 hrs. (The nakœatra was °rdra according to modern SÂrya SiddhÀnta; needs verification of the proper siddhÀnta.) The Manne plates:99 Œaka 732 elapsed (149-150 CE), Full moon day of PauÈa month, PuÈya nakœatra and lunar eclipse. The lunar eclipse was visible on 2nd Dec 149 CE in North KarõÀÇaka around 20:45 hrs to 22:11 hrs. (The nakœatra was °rdra according to modern SÂrya SiddhÀnta; needs verification of the proper siddhÀnta.) The KadaÚba plates:100 Œaka 735 elapsed, 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of JyeÈÇha month, PuÈya nakœatra. The date corresponds to 1st May 152 CE. (The nakœatra was Uttara PhÀlguni according to modern SÂrya SiddhÀnta; needs verification of the proper siddhÀnta.) Lokasena, the disciple of Guõabhadra, wrote a “Praœasti” at the end of UttarapurÀõa. Lokasena’s praœasti tells us that Jinasena, the guru of Guõabhadra, was a contemporary of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AmoghavarÈa. King AkÀlavarÈa was ruling during Lokasena’s time. Lokasena clearly mentions the Œaka era as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀbhyantara” to distinguish it from “Œaka-nÃpa-KÀlÀtÁta”. “AkÀlavarÈa-bhÂpÀle pÀlayatyakhilÀnilam......

Œri Paðchami is a special ritual performed on the Paðchami tithi before “NandÁœvara” a Jaina festival. The NandÁœvara festival is observed in the months of °ÈÀçha, KÀrttika and PhÀlguna in the bright fortnight from the AÈÇami tithi to PaurõamÀsi. Final day i.e. PaurõamÀsi of NandÁœvara is called “Taledevasa”. ŒrÀvaõa KÃÈõa Paðchami was also called as Œri Paðchami. In order to fix the exact Œri Paðchami referred to in the Uttara Purana, we have to compute the date based on the details given by Lokasena. The Eastern Chalukya inscriptions refer to the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas as RaÇÇas. The grant of AmmarÀja I102 tells us that VijayÀditya Narendra MrigarÀja fought 108 battles in 12 years against the forces of the RaÇÇas and Gaôgas. Narendra MrigarÀja (141-180 CE) was a contemporary of Govinda III & AmoghavarÈa I. This grant also tells us that GuõagÀôka VijayÀditya (182- 226 CE), at the instigation of the king of the RaÇÇas, conquered the Gaôgas and cut off the head of Maôgi in battle field. He also terrorised Krishna\n55 THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA (AkÀlavarÈa KrishnarÀja II) and burnt his city. Later, the province of Veôgi was overrun by the new RaÇÇa claimants, probably, during the reign of Chalukya BhÁma (227-256 CE). Two inscriptions of AkÀlavarÈa KrishnarÀja II: The Saundatti Inscription of PÃthivÁrÀma, a feudatory of KrishnarÀja II:103 Œaka 797 elapsed, Manmatha saÚvatsara. 213-214 CE elapsed and 214-215 CE is current; no details for verification. The Mulgund Inscription of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Krishnavallabha:104 Œaka 824 elapsed, and Dundubhi saÚvatsara. 240-241 CE elapsed and 241- 242 CE is current; no details for veification. The chronology of the Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Dynasty: The list of inscriptions of the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas is given in Appendix III. The chronology of Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas has been reconstructed based on the inscriptions dated in Œaka coronation era (583 BCE). Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE GovindarÀja 600-620? 16-37 CE? KarkarÀja 620-640? 37-56 CE? IndrarÀja 640-661? 57-77 CE? Dantidurga (also known as SÀhasatuôga, KhaçgÀvaloka) 662-676 78-93 CE KrishnarÀja (also known as AkÀlavarÈa, Shubhattuôga) 677-692 94-109 CE GovindarÀja II (also known as PrabhÂtavarÈa) 692-706 109-123 CE DhruvarÀja (also known as DhÀrÀvarÈa, Nirupama) 706-724 123-140 CE GovindarÀja III (also known as PrabhÂtavarÈa, Jagattuôga) 724-740 140-157 CE AmoghavarÈa I 740-796 157-213 CE AkÀlavarÈa Krishnaraja II 797-832 213-249 CE According to the Pulivarru grant of AmmarÀja I, IndaparÀja was the king of MÀnyakheÇa (Œri-MÀnyakheÇÀdhipatirindaparÀja nÀmÀ vidita- mahÀraÇÇavaÚœajaÍ prakaÇaguõaÍ).105 AmmarÀja ruled for seven years around 257-263 CE. The author of “JwÀlÀ MÀlini Kalpa” stated that he\n56 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA completed the work in Œaka 861 elapsed (278-279 CE) during the reign of KrishnarÀja (AÈÇa-œata-saika-ÈaÈti-pramÀõa-Œaka-saÚvatsareÈu atÁteÈu Œri- MÀnyakheÇa-kaÇake parvaõyakœaya-tritÁyÀyÀm.... Œri-KrishnarÀja-rÀjye samÀptametat....).106 The Chedi king KrishnarÀja was probably ruling around Œaka 861 (278-279 CE). According to the Œravaõabelagola inscription,107 IndrarÀja III died in Œaka 904 (320-321 CE). The rule of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas ended due to the rise of Western Chalukyas in the beginning of the 4th century CE. The Later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas Interestingly, the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas were ruling till they were conquered by the early Chalukya JayasiÚha I (225-200 BCE). The Miraj plates108 tell us that Chalukya JayasiÚha I defeated one RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king Indra, the son of Krishna to establish the Chalukya kingdom. “Yo RÀÈÇrakÂÇa-kulamindra iti prasiddhaÚ KÃÈõÀhvayasya sutamaÈÇaœatebhasainyaÚ| nirjitya dagdha-nÃpa-paðca-œato babhÀra bhÂyaœchÀlukya-kula-vallabha-rÀjalakœmÁÚ || ” Two Bijapur inscriptions109 of VÁranÀrÀyaõa dated in Œaka 1109 (17th October 525 CE) and NavasÀri grant110 tells us that VÁranÀrÀyaõa regained and re-established the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Empire which was lost to the Chalukyas. “NimagnÀm yaschÀlukyÀbdhau RaÇÇa-rÀjya-œriyam punaÍ, PÃthvÁmivoddharan DhÁro VÁranÀrÀyaõo’bhavat |” It is evident that the early Chalukya JayasiÚha I dethroned a RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king Indra, the son of Krishna and founded the early Chalukya kingdom. Dantidurga and KrishnarÀja established the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Empire by defeating the early Chalukyas at the end of 1st century CE. It appears that the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas again lost their kingdom to the Chalukyas in the beginning of the 4th century CE. Some later inscriptions of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas claim that the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas were the YÀdavas and the descendants of Yadu. It seems that the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa- YÀdava king VÁranÀrÀyÀõa re-established the rule of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas again in the 6th century CE. The Tadakal (Gulbarga) inscription111 of AmoghavarÈa, the earliest inscription of the later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas to mention VÁranÀrÀyaõa, is dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 651(729 CE). Interestingly, this\n57 inscription starts with the invocation “Namastuôga ciraœcuÚbi....” which is commonly found in YÀdava inscriptions. The Gokak plates112 of Sendraka king Indrananda mention a RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king DejjÀ MahÀrÀja. These plates are dated in Gupta era 845 elapsed. Considering the epoch of the Gupta era in 335 BCE, the year, in which these plates were issued, was 510-511 CE. The epoch of the Gupta era will be discussed in detail in",

The list of inscriptions of the later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas dated in Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era i.e. ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) is given in Appendix IV. We can easily reconstruct the chronology of the later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas and the Gujarat branch of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas who ruled around the period 8th to 10th century CE. The rise of the KalyÀõi Chalukyas in the 10th century CE ended the rule of the later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas.

Early Gaôgas started ruling over the Koôgu region of Tamilnadu THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n58 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA (the modern districts of Salem, Dharmapuri and Coimbatore) Anantapur and KolÀr districts and gradually established the empire of the Gaôgas in GaôgavÀdi i.e. Bangalore, Tumkur and Mysore districts. Elephant was the emblem of Gaôga dynasty. The majority of Early Gaôga inscriptions were found in this region. Greek accounts of the 3rd century BCE mention the region of Gaôgadhikara as Gaôgaridae which was ruled over by the king of Presii. Pliny also refers to the rulers of Gaôgadhikara as Gaôgaridae Kalingae, thereby reinforcing the evidence that the Eastern Gaôga dynasty of Kaliôga was ruling prior to the 3rd century BCE. There are several theories about the origin of the Gaôga Dynasty. The inscriptions of the Western Gaôgas claim that the Gaôgas were JÀhnavÁyas (sons of Gaôga) and belonged to the KÀõvÀyana gotra. It seems that the Gaôgas were either direct descendants of the imperial KÀõvÀyana dynasty of Magadha or an offshoot. According to later Gaôga inscriptions, Hariœchandra had a son named Bharata. VijayamahÀdevi, the wife of Bharata, took a bath in the Gaôga River at the time of conception and the son born subsequently was named GaôgÀdatta. The descendants of GaôgÀdatta were the Gaôgas. According to later Jaina records, Gaôga King PadmanÀbha sent his sons, Diçiga and MÀdhava, towards the south during the time of aggression from a neighbouring ruler (MahipÀla of Ujjain). Diçiga and MÀdhava arrived at Perur and met a Jaina °chÀrya SiÚhanandi who supported them in establishing the kingdom of the Gaôga Dynasty in KuvalÀlapura (KolÀr). Later inscriptions like the Kulagana plates of ŒivamÀra I and the Kudlur plates of Marasimha also refer to the Jaina °chÀrya SiÚhanandi. This story may have evolved because Jaina °chÀryas secured the patronage of later Gaôga Kings. Koôgani Varman was the founder of Gaôga dynasty. Kudlapura stone inscription113 gives a date as Œaka 25 elapsed (ŒakavarÈam gateÈu paðcaviÚœati 25 neya), ŒubhakÃt saÚvatsara, PhÀlguna œuddha paðcamÁ, RohiõÁ nakœatra and Œanivara (Saturday) referring to Prathama Gaôga (First Gaôga) Koôgani MÀdhava Varman. This corresponds to 7th Feb 557 BCE; however, the weekday was Wednesday. No further information is available as to how Œaka 25 is linked to the first Gaôga King Koôgani MÀdhava Varman but the nakœatra was RohiõÁ on 7th Feb 557 BCE. Possibly, the forefathers of Koôgani Varman established the Gaôga\n59 kingdom in Œaka 25 (557 BCE). According to the Hebbata grant of DurvinÁta,114 MÀdhava VarmÀ or MadivarmÀ was the father of Koôgani Varman. A Tamil Chronicle115 called “Koôgu-deœa-RÀjakkal” places the reign of Koôgani Varman in Œaka 111 (473-472 BCE). Earlier, seven kings of RaÇÇa lineage had ruled over the Koôgu region. Koôgani Varman dethroned the last RaÇÇa king Œri Vikrama Deva Chakravarty and established the Gaôga Kingdom in Koôgudeœa in Œaka 111. The Sasanakota grant116 was issued in the 1st regnal year of MÀdhava Varman I, the son of Koôgani Varman and the Kandasala grant117 was issued in his 9th regnal year. He was a learned king and authored a commentary on the “Dattaka SÂtra”. MÀdhava Varman I had three sons namely Krishnavarman also known as Vijaya Krishnavarman, °ryavarman also known as Ayyavarman and Harivarman also known as Arivarman. The Tanjore plates (Œaka 169)118 and the Tagadur plates (Œaka 188)119 indicate that Harivarman was the one of the earliest users of the Œaka coronation era (epoch in 583 BCE) in South India. Possibly, the Œaka era calendar had become popular by then. These plates provide verifiable details of the reign of MÀdhava Varman I. The Tanjore Plates: Œaka 169 elapsed, “Prabhava” SaÚvatsara, New moon day of PhÀlguna month, RevatÁ nakœatra, VÃddhi yoga, VÃÈabha lagna and BÃguvÀra (Friday). 415-414 BCE elapsed and 414-413 BCE is current. 1st March 413 BCE was the new moon day of PhÀlguna and the nakœatra Revati. The Tagadur Plates: Œaka 188 elapsed, “Vibhava” saÚvatsara, the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month, Punarvasu nakœatra and GuruvÀra (Thursday). 396-395 BCE elapsed and 395-394 BCE is current. 29th Jan 393 BCE was the œukla daœamÁ of PhÀlguna month and the nakœatra was Punarvasu. The Kudlur Plates:120 Year 88? or 188? or 198? The era is not mentioned. MÀgha masa, AmÀvÀsyÀ, SvÀti nakœatra, sÂrya grahaõa, somavara. Needs verification. The Kudlur grant probably refers to the 88th year of Gaôga rule from Koôgani Varman (Œaka 111). Thus the year intended is Probably, 198th year of Œaka (386-385 BCE). A solar eclipse occurred on 25th September 386 BCE when the nakœatra was SvÀti but the month °œvina. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n60 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Harivarman was also the earliest Gaôga king to be associated with TÀlavanapura (TÀlakad). The Tanjore grant of Harivarman relates an interesting story: A Buddhist philosopher named “VÀdimadagajendra” came to TÀlavanapura and affixed a letter of challenge on the main door of the palace for a debate on the subject of the existence of the soul. A BrÀhmaõa named MÀdhava BhaÇÇa took the challenge and, in the debate which took place in the court of Harivarman, he put forth his arguments in favour of the existence of the soul (ÀtmÀ) while the Buddhist scholar denied the existence of the soul. MÀdhava BhaÇÇa defeated the Buddhist scholar and established the theory of the existence of the soul. A very pleased Harivarman gave the BrÀhmaõa the title “VÀdibhasiÚha” and gifted him “Varakodu” or Orekodu village in the east of Mysore. JF Fleet declared the Tanjore grant spurious because he could not digest the early date of the grant (Œaka 169). On the basis of palaeography which in itself is based on distorted chronology, he propagated that the grant was written in the late characters of the 10th century. In reality, the archaic Telugu-Kannada script had remained the same almost for 1000 years. This can be construed from the Tanjore plates (Œaka 169) and Sudi plates (Œaka 860). There are many other instances of such scripts that continued without any major change. For example, the Babylonian script remained almost the same from the 18th century BCE till the 2nd century BCE. Truly speaking, John Faithful Fleet’s unfaithful palaeography is a forgery and spurious, not the Tanjore grant. Western historians and their followers tied themselves in knots by selectively declaring some of the Gaôga inscriptions as forgeries or spurious based on their distorted theory of palaeography. There is still a divergence of opinion among historians in this regard. Palaeography can be supporting evidence but it cannot be the primary evidence to reject certain inscriptions as forgeries. Unfortunately, some of the inscriptions have been rejected because they were found to be contrary to the distorted chronology given by Western historians, whereas their entire theory of palaeography was based on the distorted chronology of ancient India. There is a serious need to study the evolution of ancient Indian scripts without any prejudice from the theories propounded by Western\n61 scholars. Just for the sake of argument, if any inscription is found in late characters, is it not possible that a replica or a copy of the damaged ancient inscription might have been made at a later date with the permission of a descendant king of the same dynasty? The tendency to declare ancient Indian inscriptions as forgeries or spurious without any concrete evidence is highly objectionable and must be repudiated with the contempt it deserves. In fact, the entire nonsense of rejecting inscriptions forgeries was started by JF Fleet. As the dates given in certain Gaôga inscriptions cannot be correctly calculated in ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE), he came up this insidious scheme of labelling these inscriptions forgeries and or spurious. These Gaôga inscriptions clearly refer to “Œaka-varÈeÈu atÁteœhu” not “Œaka- kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œateÈu”. Thus, these Gaôga inscriptions belong to the Œaka era (583 BCE) not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Interestingly, JF Fleet initially believed that all Gaôga kings up to ŒripuruÈa were fictitious personalities but he had to change his stand later. B Lewis Rice, then Director of the archaeological researches in Mysore, accepted all Gaôga inscriptions as genuine but JF Fleet was wily enough to overrule him. As shown above, the dates of inscriptions of Harivarman can be correctly calculated considering the epoch of Œaka era in 583 BCE. Harivarman had two brothers namely °ryavarman and Krishnavarman. Historians generally accept that °ryavarman and Krishnavarman are the same personality but there is no concrete evidence to prove it. It appears that there was a succession struggle between the three brothers. The Pallava king SiÚhavarman coronated °ryavarman and later, the Pallava king Skandavarman coronated MÀdhava SiÚhavarman, the son of °ryavarman as the successor of the Gaôga kingdom in KuvalÀla or KolÀr region.121 Krishnavarman or Vijaya Krishnavarman122 also ruled for some time and later, his son SiÚhavarman123 became the king. There is no further information available about the descendants of °ryavarman and Krishnavarman. Harivarman’s son Vishnugopa succeeded him. It seems that Harivarman and Vishnugopa ruled for over a century. The Harihar grant of the unnamed son of Vishnugopa124 was issued around Œaka 272 (311 BCE) in “SÀdhÀraõa” saÚvatsara. Vishnugopa had two sons. According THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n62 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA to Lewis Rice, RÀja Malla was probably the unnamed son of Vishnugopa who issued Harihar grant. MÀdhava II was the second son of Vishnugopa. He married the sister of the KadaÚba king Krishnavarman. Mallohalli plates125 indicate that MÀdhava II ruled for over 29 years. JF Fleet declared it spurious because his distorted chronology had not enough room to accommodate the rule of more than 29 years of MÀdhava II. Bannitalapura grant of MÀdhava II was issued on the occasion of lunar eclipse on MÀrgaœÁrÈa PÂrõimÀ in Œaka 280 (304-303 BCE). The date regularly corresponds to 1st Nov 304 BCE and it is quite likely that 304-303 BCE was the first regnal year of MÀdhava II. The chronology of the Early Gaôga kings up to MÀdhava II: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE MÀdivarmÀ or MÀdhava Varman 25? — Koôgani Varman 111-134 472-447 BCE MÀdhava I 135-167 448-416 BCE Harivarman 168-218 415-365 BCE Vishnugopa 219-269 364-314 BCE Unnamed elder son of Vishnugopa 270-280 313-304 BCE MÀdhava II (Younger son of Vishnugopa) 280-324 304-259 BCE AvinÁta was the successor of MÀdhava II. It is evident from the Sringeri126 and Kondinjeruru127 plates that AvinÁta was the youngest child. He was coronated while still in the lap of his mother (JananÁ-devatÀôka- paryaôkatala-samadhigata-rÀjya-vaibhava-vilÀsena). AvinÁta married the daughter of the PunnÀta King Skandavarman. He had two sons namely DurvinÁta and NirvinÁta. Based on the regnal years mentioned in the inscriptions, it is evident that AvinÁta and DurvinÁta, father and son, also ruled for over a century. AvinÁta might have had the longer tenure because he became king when still a child. Thus, it seems that AvinÁta ruled for 64 years from Œaka 325 to Œaka 389 (258-194 BCE). The verifiable details of inscriptions of the Gaôga king AvinÁta: The ŒÃngeri Grant:128 2nd Regnal year, VaiœÀkha œukla 5 and PauÈa œukla daœamÁ, RohiõÁ nakœatra with reference to Avinita’s mother BÃhad Devi.\n63 21st Mar 257 BCE was VaiœÀkha œukla paðcamÁ and 17th Dec 257 BCE was PauÈa œukla daœamÁ and the nakœatra RohiõÁ. The Residency Plates:129 25th Regnal year, KÀrttika œukla paðcamÁ, UttarÀÈÀçha nakœatra. The date was 18th Oct 233 BCE and the nakœatra UttarÀÈÀçhÀ. The Kudunjeruvu Grant:130 25th Regnal year, BhÀdrapada œukla daœamÁ, PÂrvabhadrÀ nakœatra, Thursday. UttarÀÈÀçhÀ was on daœamÁ (25th Aug 233 BCE) and PÂrvabhadrÀ was on PÂrõimÀ (29th Aug 233 BCE). The Merkara Grant:131 Œaka 388, MÀgha month, œukla paðcami, SvÀti nakœatra, SomavÀra (Monday). The date was 26th Dec 196 BCE, but the nakœatra was PÂrvabhadrÀ. The date was probably 10th Jan 195 BCE, MÀgha kÃÈõa paðcamÁ, SvÀti nakœatra. DurvinÁta, the son of AvinÁta and the daughter of the PunnÀta king Skandavarman, succeeded his father. He was a great patron of learning. He wrote a commentary on the 15th Sarga (canto) of KirÀtÀrjunÁyam in his 20th regnal year (173 BCE). The great poet BhÀravi was the author of KirÀtÀrjunÁyam. DurvinÁta authored a grammatical work known as “ŒabdÀvatÀra” and translated “BÃhat-KathÀ” into Sanskrit. GuõÀçhya authored BÃhat-KathÀ in PaiœÀchi, a literary dialect of Prakrit and it was known as “Vaçça-KathÀ”. BhÀravi was a contemporary of Gaôga King DurvinÁta. A Sanskrit work “AvantisundarÁkathÀ” relates an interesting story about BhÀravi. One day, BhÀravi met the Pallava King SiÚhavishnu as a stranger and recited a Sanskrit verse in praise of NarasiÚha, incarnation of Vishnu. Pallava SiÚhavishnu enquired of BhÀravi who the author of this verse was. BhÀravi replied thus: “In the North-West there is a town named Anandapura, the crest jewel of °rya-deœa, from which a family of Brahmaõas of the Kauœika gotra migrated and settled at Achalapura. NarayaõaswÀmi, a member of this family, had a son named DÀmodara, who became a great scholar and was known as BhÀravi. He became a friend of the Chalukya Vishnuvardhana. On one occasion, he accompanied the king on a hunting expedition and while in the forest had to eat animal flesh. To expiate this sin he set out on a pilgrimage and finally settled in the court of DurvinÁta. He is the author of this verse.”132 THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n64 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA It is evident that BhÀravi was a contemporary of the Chalukya Vishnuvardhana, the Gaôga DurvinÁta and the Pallava SiÚhavishnu. The Cellur grant of Chalukya Vira Choda,133 Kalpataru grant of VijayÀditya134 and the inscription of Tribhuvanamalla135 tell us that Chalukya kings were endowed with the special coronation names Vishnuvardhana and VijayÀditya (Vishnuvardhana-VijayÀdityÀdi-viœeÈa-nÀmnÀm). Vishnuvardhana - JayasiÚha I VijayÀditya - RaõarÀga Vishnuvardhana - Pulakeœin I Based on the regnal period of Pulakeœin I (172-117 BCE), it is evident that BhÀravi lived between 220 BCE and140 BCE. BhÀravi was a contemporary of the early Chalukya Vishnuvardhana-JayasiÚha I or Vishnuvardhana-Pulakeœin I and not the Eastern Chalukya Kubja Vishnuvardhana as wrongly identified by historians. The inscriptions of DurvinÁta indicate that he ruled for over 40 years. Some inscriptions refer to him as “VÃddharÀja”. Thus, the reign of DurvinÁta can be fixed between Œaka 390 and Œaka 445 (193-138 BCE). Historians wrongly identified NirvinÁta as DurvinÁta. The Tagare grant136 of PolavÁra mentions NirvinÁta as the son of AvinÁta. The Serugunda stone inscription137 also mentions NirvinÁta. It is more logical to conclude that AvinÁta had two sons i.e. DurvinÁta and NirvinÁta. PolavÁra was the son of NirvinÁta not DurvinÁta. The verifiable details of Gaôga king DurvinÁta’s inscriptions: The Kadagattur Grant:138 4th Regnal year, MÀgha œuddha SaptamÁ and RevatÁ nakœatra. The date corresponds to 22nd Dec 190 BCE. The Uttanur Plates:139 20th Regnal year, KÀrttika PÂrõimÀ, KÃttikÀ nakœatra and Abhijit muhÂrta. The date corresponds to 24th Oct 173 BCE. The Hebbata Grant:140 31st Regnal year, PhÀlguna PÂrõimÀ, Uttara... nakœatra. The date corresponds to 18th Feb 161 BCE, PhÀlguna pÂrõimÀ and Uttara PhÀlgunÁ nakœatra.\n65 The Saliggame Grant:141 39th Regnal year, KÀrttika œuddha puõya tithi, ŒatabhiÈaj nakœatra. The date corresponds to 30th Sep 155 BCE, KÀrttika œuddha daœamÁ and ŒatabhiÈaj nakœatra. The Nallala Grant:142 40th Regnal year, VaiœÀkha prathama pakœa, parva (lunar eclipse?), ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra, brÀhma muhÂrta. The date corresponds to 1st April 154 BCE, VaiœÀkha PÂrõimÀ and ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra. A lunar eclipse was also visible at 19:28 hrs. MuÈkara, the son of DurvinÁta, also had a very long reign though his records are very few. The British museum grant of MuÈkara143 mentions him as “Mokkara VÃddharÀja”. JF Fleet declared it spurious because he could not accommodate a “VÃddharÀja” in his distorted chronology. Kulagana grant144 of ŒivamÀra I also refers to him as “Œrimat Koôgani VÃddharÀja”. Œrivikrama succeeded his father MuÈkara and married the daughter of SindhurÀja (Sakala-digantara-prasiddha- SindhurÀja-duhitÃvaraÍ). He also married the daughter of a Chola king descended from the reputed KarikÀla. The Bedirur grant145 tells us that BhÂvikrama was born to Œrivikrama and the daughter of a Chola king (KÀrita-kÀverÁtÁra-karikÀla-kula-vaÚœotpanna-Chola-nÃpati-putrÁ-putraÍ). BhÂvikrama started ruling from Œaka 531 (52 BCE) because the Bedirur grant was issued in his 25th regnal year (Œaka 556). He defeated a Pallava king during his reign and ruled for a long period. ŒivakumÀra or ŒivamÀra I, the youngest brother of BhÂvikrama, succeeded him. He was also known as NavakÀma. The Hallagere grant146 of his 34th regnal year is dated, Œaka 635 (51-52 CE) which means ŒivamÀra I ascended the throne in Œaka 601 (17-18 CE). BhÂvikrama’s reign appears to be very long from Œaka 531(52 BCE) to Œaka 600 (17 CE) and is probably inclusive of his reign as YuvarÀja. ŒivamÀra I ruled up to Œaka 648 (65 CE) and lived a full life of hundred years. ŒivamÀra’s grandson ŒripuruÈa succeeded him. The Javali plates147 give Œaka 672 (89 CE) as his 25th regnal year and the Nallamangala plates148 give Œaka 698 (115 CE) as his 50th regnal year. Thus, Œaka 699 (116 CE) was probably the last year of ŒripuruÈa’s reign. Interestingly, the reigns of all Gaôga kings up to ŒripuruÈa spanned long periods. The Kulagana plates149 used the term “VÃddharÀja” (grand old king) for almost all of these kings. The Gaôga kings were patrons of THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n66 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA learning and rarely ventured to expand the territories of the Gaôga Empire. They maintained peaceful relations with neighbouring kings. It appears that BhÂvikrama had the longest reign of 69 years; there is nothing inherently improbable about the duration of the reign of BhÂvikrama as he may have started his rule at the age of 15 or 16 as YuvarÀja. ŒivamÀra II succeeded ŒripuruÈa in Œaka 700 (117 CE). According to the Manne plates,150 ŒivamÀra ventured to defeat the Vallabha army consisting of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa, Chalukya, Haihaya and other brave leaders encamped at the village called Mudugudur. The Manne grant of Govinda III151 tells us that DhÀrÀvarÈa Dhruva imprisoned a Gaôga king and that the imprisoned Gaôga was certainly ŒivamÀra II. Later, YuvarÀja Govinda III pardoned and released him. Thus, the Gaôgas became the allies of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. The Manne plates of ŒivamÀra II inform us that ŒivamÀradeva was reinstated by RÀÈÇrakÂÇa GovindarÀja III and Pallava NandivarmÀ (RÀÈÇrakÂÇa-PallavÀnvaya-tilakÀbhyÀm mÂrdhÀbhiÈikta-GovindarÀja- NandivarmÀ-bhidheyÀbhyÀm samanuÈÇhita-rÀjyÀbhiÈekÀbhyÀm). YuvarÀja\n67 MÀrasiÚha ascended the throne in Œaka 719 (136 CE) because the Kottimba grant of his 3rd regnal year is dated, Œaka 721 (138 CE). The verifiable details of Gaôga inscriptions: The Arekere grant of Œrivikrama:152 1st regnal year, KÀrttika PÂrõimÀ, RohiõÁ nakœatra, lunar eclipse and SomavÀra (Monday). The date corresponds to 27th Oct 81 BCE, KÀrttika PÂrõimÀ and RohiõÁ nakœatra. Lunar Eclipse was visible between 20:14 hrs to 1:06 hrs but it was Saturday. The Bedirur grant of BhÂvikrama:153 Œaka 556, 25th regnal year, Chaitra œukla daœamÁ, MaghÀ nakœatra, Thursday. The date corresponds to 13th March 28 BCE, Chaitra œukla daœamÁ and °œleÈa/MaghÀ nakœatra. The Agali grant of ŒripuruÈa:154 Œaka 669 elapsed, 22nd Regnal year, MÀgha œukla trayodaœÁ, Punarvasu nakœatra. The date corresponds to 5th/6th Jan 87 CE and the nakœatra was Punarvasu.

ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra, lunar eclipse, ŒukravÀra (Friday). Irregular. The lunar eclipse was on 25th March 99 CE but it was Chaitra Purnima and ViœÀkhÀ nakœatra; needs verification from the original text of the inscription. The Manne plates of MÀrasiÚha:157 Œaka 719, °ÈÀçha œukla? PaðcamÁ, Uttara bhadrÀ nakœatra. Irregular; needs verification from the original text of the inscription. The Kottimba grant of MÀrasiÚha:158 Œaka 721, ŒrÀvaõa, œuddha pÂrõimÀ, DaniÈÇhÀ nakœatra, Lunar eclipse, SomavÀra (Monday). The date corresponds to 29th July 139 CE, ŒrÀvaõa PÂrõimÀ and the nakœatra was DhaniÈÇhÀ. A lunar eclipse was visible between 4:18 hrs to 5:51 hrs. The Perjjarangi grant of RÀjamalla I:159 Œaka 741 elapsed (158-159 CE), Solar eclipse. The solar eclipse was visible on 13th July 158 CE between 14.03 hrs to 15.19 hrs. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n68 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The Narsapura grant of RÀjamalla II:160 Œaka 824, PhÀlguna month, œukla pakœa, paðcamÁ, RohiõÁ nakœatra, BudhavÀra (Wednesday). RohiõÁ nakœatra was on SaptamÁ and not on paðcamÁ and the day was 6th Feb 241 CE. The Gattavadipura grant of RÀjamalla III:161 Œaka 826 elapsed, MÀrgaœÁrÈa month, full moon day, MÃgaœirÀ nakœatra, lunar eclipse and Sunday. A penumbral lunar eclipse was visible on 14th Dec 243 CE. The chronology of the Gaôga kings from AvinÁta to MÀrasiÚha: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE AvinÁta 325-389 258-194 BCE DurvinÁta 390-445 193-138 BCE MuÈkara 446-501 137-82 BCE ŒripuruÈa 501-531 82-52 BCE BhÂvikrama 531-600 52 BCE-17 CE ŒivamÀra I also known as NavakÀma, Œrivallabha 601-648 18-65 CE ŒripuruÈa 649-699 66-116 CE ŒivamÀra II also known as Saygotta 700-719 117-136 CE MÀrasiÚha 719-733 136-150 CE VijayÀditya, the youngest brother of ŒivamÀra II, succeeded MÀrasiÚha. No details are available as to how VijayÀditya, the uncle of MÀrasiÚha, ascended the throne but the Sudi plates162 of Butuga II tell us that he ruled for a short period (SaÚkœipta-kÀleya-carito’bhavat). RÀjamalla I, the son of VijayÀditya, started his rule around Œaka 740 (157 CE). According to the Galigakere plates, NÁtimÀrga I, the son of RÀjamalla I was ruling in Œaka 782 (199 CE). Also known as Eragaôgadeva, he destroyed his foes in the battle of “RÀmati”. The reign of RÀjamalla II, the son of NÁtimÀrga I, can be placed between Œaka 810 (227 CE) to 824 (241 CE) because the NarsÀpura grant163 is dated, Œaka 824 (241 CE). He was victorious in the battle of “Samiya”. Butuga I, the younger brother of RÀjamalla II, succeeded him. Butuga I, whose second name was “GuõaduttarÀôga”, married “AbbÀlabbÀ” the daughter of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa King AmoghavarÈa and defeated a Pallava King.\n69 NÁtimÀrga II or Eragaôgadeva was the son of Butuga I; he was also known as “KomÀravedÀôga” and according to the Sudi plates, was coronated by his uncle RÀjamalla II (sva-pitÃvyena RÀjamallena.... PaÇÇa- baddhaÍ). He effected a public defeat of the Pallavas in a battle at “Jantepperupenjeru”. NarasiÚhadeva, the son of Eragaôgadeva succeeded him. He was also known as “VÁravedÀôga”. RÀjamalla III (also known as NÁtimÀrga III), the son of NarasiÚhadeva, succeeded him. He was also known as “Kachcheya Gaôga”. It appears that the rule of the Gaôga dynasty ended by the time of NÁtimÀrga III. According to the Sudi and Kudlur plates,164 Butuga II, the younger brother of RÀjamalla III, had migrated to the ÷ahÀla region. He married a daughter of the Chedi King Baddega at Tripuri. After the death of Baddega, Butuga II played a crucial role in the coronation of the Chedi King Krishna by seizing the kingdom from the possession of Lalleya. He was a cause of great fear to KakkarÀja of Achalapura, Bijja Dantivarman of VanavÀsi, RÀjavarman or Ajavarman. Butuga II, who was also known as JayaduttarÀôga, GaôgagÀôgeya, GaôganÀrÀyaõa and NannÁya Gaôga, broke the pride of DÀmari, the king of Nulugugiri and NÀgavarmas. Butuga II also conquered the Chola King RÀjÀditya and seized the town of TanjÀpuri and Nalkela (Nalkote). He presented a huge amount of money, elephants and horses pillaged in this expedition to the Chedi King Krishna. As recorded in the Sudi plates, Butuga II was ruling at PurÁkarapura and Gaôgamandalam (Øhaõõavati sahasramapi Gaôgamandalam pratipÀlayan PurÁkarapure kritÀvasthitam). Surprisingly, JF Feet declared Sudi plates as spurious and eminent historians blindly followed him. According to the Kudlur plates, the elder son of Butuga II married the daughter of the Chedi King Krishna who conquered the kings of Magadha, Kaliôga, PÀnçya and Chola (Magadha-Kaliôga-PÀnçya-Chola- kœmÀpÀlaiÍ abhinuta-pÀda-paôkajasya KÃÈõasya). His first name was Puõuseya Gaôga, NÁtimÀrga, Koôgani MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and also known as Marula & Kaliyuga BhÁma. The younger brother of Puõuseya Gaôga was MÀrasiÚha, also known as GuÇÇiya Gaôga. According to the Œravaõabelagola lithic inscription,165 SatyavÀkya Koôgani MahÀrÀja (MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga) also became the king of the Gurjaras. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n70 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga became like a forest-fire for lion RÀjÀditya, the crest jewel of the Chalukyas. It is evident that GuÇÇÁya Gaôga defeated a Chola-Chalukya King RÀjÀditya. Interestingly, this inscription tells us that GuÇÇÁya Gaôga entered MÀnyakheÇa with the army of Chakravarti (KrishnarÀja) and coronated RÀÈÇrakÂÇa IndrarÀja as King of MÀnyakheta (Bhujabala.... MÀnyakheÇa-praveœita-chakravarty.... Œrimad IndrarÀja- paÇÇabandhotsavasya). MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga also conquered the king of VanavÀsi, the descendants of the Mathura dynasty and the NolaÚba, Chera, Chola, PÀnçya & Pallava kings (Bhayopanata vanavÀsÁdeœÀdi.... praõata-MÀthura- vaÚœajasya.... Sakala-NolaÚbÀdhirÀja-samara-vidhvansakasya.... PratÀpÀvanata-Chera-Chola-PÀnçya-Pallavasya). He was titled “NolaÚbakulÀntaka” the destroyer of NolaÚba Dynasty. The Œravaõabelagola lithic inscription ends with the statement that MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇiya Gaôga relinquished the sovereignty and died at BÀnkapura by the Jaina rite of “Sallekhana” (starvation) in the presence of the Jaina monk Ajitasena-BhattÀraka. The verifiable details of Gaôga inscriptions: The NarsÀpura plates of RÀjamalla II (SatyavÀkya):166 Œaka 824, 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month, RohiõÁ nakœatra, BudhavÀra (Wednesday). The date corresponds to 3rd Feb 241 CE, Wednesday but the nakœatra was AœvinÁ. The Sudi plates of Butuga II:167 Œaka 860, KÀrttika œukla aÈÇamÁ, °dityavÀra (Sunday). The date corresponds to 21st October 277 CE. The chronology of the Gaôga kings from VijayÀditya to GuÇÇÁya Gaôga: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE VijayÀditya(Youngest Brother of ŒivamÀradeva) 733-739 150-156 CE RÀjamalla I (SatyavÀkya Koôganivarman) 739-780 156-197 CE NÁtimÀrga I 780-810 197-227 CE RÀjamalla II(SatyavÀkya Koôganivarman) 810-824 227-241 CE Butuga I(Youngest Brother of RÀjamalla II) 824-825 241-242 CE NÁtimÀrga II(Eragaôgadeva) 825-826 242-243 CE\n71 Narasiôghadeva (SatyavÀkya Koôganivarman) 243 CE RÀjamalla III or NÁtimÀrga III (son of Narasiôghadeva) 826-830 243-247 CE Butuga II(brother of RÀjamalla III) 830-863 247-280 CE Puõuseya GaôgaSon of Butuga II (also known as Marula) 863-870 280-287 CE MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga (Younger brother of Puõuseya Gaôga and son of Butuga II) 870-890 287-307 CE GuÇÇÁya Gaôga was probably the last sovereign ruler of the Gaôga dynasty. Unfortunately, not much information is available about the Gaôgas of TÀlakad from the 4th century CE to the 8th century CE. Evidently, Gangas lost their sovereignity by the 4th century CE. All early Gaôga inscriptions are available in the form of copper plates and dated in Œaka-kÀla era (583 BCE) except three grants (Kudlur,168 Kadalur169 & Kukkanur170) of MÀrasiÚha which are dated in Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta era (78 CE). Most of the Gaôga lithic inscriptions are dated in Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era (78 CE). It appears that the Gaôgas re-emerged as feudatories of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas during 9th & 10th centuries CE with control restricted to the regions of KuvalÀlapura (KolÀr) and Nandagiri (Nandidoorg) as the inscriptions of this period refer to the Gaôga kings as “KuvalÀlapura- vÀreœvara NandagirinÀtha”. Initially, the Gaôgas started ruling in the Paruvi, Koôgu and KuvalÀla regions. HarivarmÀ established TÀlakad (TÀlavanapura) as the capital of the Gaôga Dynasty by 375 BCE. ŒivamÀra I and ŒripuruÈa shifted the capital to MÀnyapura (Manne) around 25 CE. Butuga II was ruling at PurÁkarapura in 277 CE. Finally, the Gaôgas settled at KuvalÀlapura and Nandagiri as feudatories of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. The Kudlur, Kadalur & Kukkanur grants of MÀrasiÚha are dated in Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta i.e. ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) from the year 884 to 890 (962- 968 CE). These grants are comprehensive historical documents of the Gaôgas of TÀlakad and provide detailed genealogy of the Gaôgas from Koôgani Varman to GuÇÇÁya Gaôga (also known as MÀrasiÚha). Some historians wrongly identified the MÀrasiÚha of the grants of Kudlur, Kadalur & Kukkanur with GuÇÇÁya Gaôga (younger son of Butuga II). These grants used the verb “ÀsÁt” for MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n72 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “°sÁt jagad-gahana-rakœaõa rÀjasiÚhaÍ kœmÀ-mandalÀbjavana-mandanarÀjasiÚhaÍ | Œri-MÀrasiÚha iti bÃÚhita-bÀhu-kÁrtiÍ tasyÀnujaÍ kÃta-yuga-kœitipÀlakÁrtiÍ || ” Evidently, MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga was not alive in ŒÀlivÀhana 884 (962 CE). The verb “ÀsÁt” cannot be used for the ruling king MÀrasiÚha, the author of the Kudlur grant. Therefore, MÀrasiÚha- GuÇÇÁya Gaôga and MÀrasiÚha of Kudlur grant were two different personalities. GuÇÇÁya Gaôga ruled around Œaka 870-890 (287-307 CE) whereas MÀrasiÚha of the Kudlur grant ruled in ŒÀlivÀhana 884-890 (962-968 CE). This also indicates that Œaka-kÀla era and Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era are two different eras with two different epochs. The later Gaôgas appear to have been ruling only as feudatories of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas during the 9th and 10th centuries. The author of the Kudlur grant claimed that he was coronated by the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king KrishnarÀja. After the 10th century CE, Gaôgas attained important positions under the Chalukyas and Hoyasalas. Interestingly, a community of Mysore is known today as the GaôgÀdikÀr VokkalingÀrs. Amazingly, the descendants of this glorious dynasty of KarõÀtaka are still surviving. Let us discuss certain distortions propounded in the historical account of the Gaôgas. The Sudi grant of Butuga II and subsequent grants mention King Baddega and Krishna. Interestingly, historians identified Baddega as the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa King AmoghavarÈa and Krishna as RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Kannara Deva or KrishnarÀja. This identification has been accepted because Butuga II can be a contemporary of AmoghavarÈa and Krishnaraja in the chronology of the ŒÀlivÀhana era. In my opinion, it is a case of mistaken identity. Historians need to address the following points: \u0002 According to the Sudi and Kudlur plates, Krishna defeated the kings of Magadha, Kaliôga, PÀnçya and Chola. The RÀÈÇrakÂÇas never conquered Magadha and Kaliôga at any point of time in their entire history. \u0002 As stated in the Œravaõabelagola lithic inscription, SatyavÀkya Koõgani MahÀrÀja MÀrasiÚha-GuÇÇÁya Gaôga coronated IndrarÀja in MÀnyakheÇa after defeating Chola-Chalukya RÀjÀditya. How could GuÇÇÁya Gaôga coronate IndrarÀja while KrishnarÀja was already on the throne?\n73 \u0002 The Sudi and Kudlur plates do not provide even an iota of evidence to prove that Baddiga and Krishna were RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. \u0002 Who was Lalleya from whom Butuga II seized the kingdom to strengthen the rule of Krishna? There was no RÀÈÇrakÂÇa descendant named Lalleya. The answer to the above anomalies lies in the fact that the Sudi plates are dated in the Œaka-kÀla era and not the Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era. Thus, Butuga II cannot be a contemporary of Baddiga AmoghavarÈa. It appears that the Early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas and the Gaôgas of TÀlakad became vulnerable around Œaka 833-850 (250-267 CE) due to the rise of the Chedi dynasty in the north and frequent aggressions from the neighbouring kings, the Eastern Chalukyas and Pallavas. The Chedi ruler of Tripuri, King Sri Vandyaga or Baddega consolidated his supremacy by conquering Magadha, Kaliôga, Kuntala and probably, the Gaôga kingdom as well. It may also be noted that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403 BCE. We will discuss this era in detail in",

Dr. VV Mirashi quoted the following invaluable extract from an ancient manuscript in possession of Dr. SN Sen, Keeper of the Nepal Museum. He personally verified this manuscript, which is a commentary on a Œaiva work, at Hyderabad at the session of the All-India Oriental Conference held there in 1941. Gatavati Œaka-kÀle maôgaleÈvaÈÇa-saôkhye, Œaradi viÈadapakœe cÀœvine œukravÀre | Uçuni SurapatÁœe yoga °yuÈmatÁyam, Tithirapi ca gatÀnÀm paðcamÁ yatra œuddhÀ || ChedikularÀjadhÀnyÀm gatavati Œri Vandyage nihatyÀrÁn | TaccÍÀsanena vasudhÀm parirakœati KÃÈõarÀje’pi || 171 “When Œaka year 858 elapsed, on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of °œvina Month, Friday, °yuÈmatÁ Yoga, King Œri Vandyaga or Baddega went back to Tripuri, the capital city of the Chedi dynasty after defeating all his enemies while KrishnarÀja was governing the country as YuvarÀja from the city of MÀnyakheÇa”. The date is regular with 12th Sep 275 CE (or 22nd Sep 274 CE). The era mentioned here is Œaka-kÀla not Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n74 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA It is evident that Butuga II was the contemporary of Chedi Baddega and not RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Baddiga because all inscriptions of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Baddiga are dated in the Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era. When the Gaôgas lost their kingdom, Butuga II may have approached King Baddega at Tripuri and impressed upon him that he could be instrumental in strengthening the Chedi rule in the Southern region. Baddega married off his daughter to Butuga II to ensure his loyalty to the Chedi kings. Thus, Butuga II became the patron of KrishnarÀja, the Chedi king of Southern region and seized the kingdom from the possession of Lalleya. Lalleya may have been another Chedi prince or a disloyal feudatory. Butuga II strengthened the rule of the Chedi YuvarÀja Krishna after the death of his elder brother Baddega by defeating KakkarÀja of Achalapura, Bijja Dantivarman of VanavÀsi, RÀjavarman or Ajavarman, Damari the king of Nulugugiri and the NÀgavarmas. He also extended the Chedi kingdom up to TanjÀpuri. This is exactly why, as the Kudlur plates tell us, the kings of Magadha, Kaliôga, PÀnçya and Chola bowed to the feet of KrishnarÀja. The RÀÈÇrakÂÇas never conquered Magadha and Kaliôga. Butuga II’s two sons i.e. Puõuseya Gaôga and GuÇÇiya Gaôga followed the footsteps of his father. Puõuseya Gaôga married the daughter of the Chedi King KrishnarÀja. Thus, the Gaôgas not only ruled GaôgavÀdi but also some parts of the Gurjara region at the end of the 3rd century CE around 280-300 CE. Probably, the rise of ParamÀra dynasty and Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi ended the rule of the Gaôga dynasty. All dated lithic inscriptions of the Gaôgas belong to the ŒÀlivÀhana era and not the Œaka era. Most of these inscriptions were written in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. The Atakur inscription172 is dated in Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era (ŒÀlivÀhana 872). Therefore, the Butuga III mentioned in the Atakur inscription cannot be Butuga II because they belonged to two different eras. Butuga III of Atakur inscription lived around ŒÀlivÀhana 872 (949- 950 CE) and was a feudatory of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas whereas Butuga II of the Sudi plates belonged to Œaka 860 (277 CE) and was the sovereign ruler of a larger kingdom including Gaôgavadi 96000. Thus, the chronology of the later Gaôgas must be reconstructed based on lithic inscriptions dated in the Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era. Only MÀrasiÚha among the later Gaôgas could become a sovereign ruler with the blessings of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa KrishnarÀja (ahamiva nijarÀjyabhÀra-samuddharaõa-kœama iti\n75 svayam-kÃta-Gaôgapati-paÇÇa-bandhotsavo Gaôga-mÀnçalikaÍ) around ŒÀlivÀhana 884 (961-962 CE). The BÀõa Dynasty BÀõas were the one of the earliest rulers of KolÀr region of KarõÀtaka and some parts of Andhra Pradesh. They claimed to be descendants of King BÀõa who was the son of MahÀbali. They might have been connected with MahÀbalipuram. Koôgani Varman, the founder of the Gaôga dynasty, had possibly conquered some parts of the BÀõa kingdom in the 5th century BCE. Many inscriptions of the BÀõa kings were found in the KolÀr region. The Mudyanur grant of the BÀõa king Malladeva NandivarmÀ tells us that after many BÀõa kings had passed away, there was a king named NandivarmÀ (400-375 BCE) whose grandson Malladeva NandivarmÀ was ruling in Œaka 261 (322 BCE). Malladeva NandivarmÀ, the son of VijayÀditya (375-344 BCE), issued the Mudyanur grant in his 23rd regnal year which means he ascended the throne in Œaka 239 (344 BCE). The selected text from the Mudyanur grant:173 “EkaÈaÈÇÇuttara-dvaya-œate ŒakÀbdaÍ PravardhamÀnÀtmanaÍ trayo- viÚœati-vartamÀna-Vilambi-saÚvatsare KÀrttika-œukla-pakœe trayodaœyÀm SomavÀre AœvinyÀm nakœatre....” Œaka 261 (323-322 BCE) elapsed, Vilambi saÚvatsara, 23rd regnal year, 13th tithi of the bright fortnight of KÀrttika month, AœvinÁ nakœatra and Monday. This regularly corresponds to 19th October 322 BCE but the weekday was Friday. Interestingly, the backside of the first plate of the Mudyanur grant is an erased Gaôga grant. The genealogy of the Gaôga kings is given up to the time of Harivarman on the erased side which also validates the date of the Mudyanur grant. The Gaôga King Harivarman ruled around 415-365 BCE and the Mudyanur grant was issued in 322 BCE. Therefore, Malladeva NandivarmÀ was a contemporary of the Gaôga king Vishnugopa. JF Fleet and Kielhorn declared the Mudyanur grant as spurious because the Jovian year “Vilambi” and the weekday (Monday) given in the grant are not regular. There were various theories of the 60 year cycle in vogue in ancient India but only 3 or 4 theories survive today. Moreover, the surviving THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n76 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA theories may have also undergone midcourse corrections. Similarly, many siddhÀntas of Ahargaõa were existing in ancient times and the siddhÀntas followed in the ancient calendars need to be decoded to determine the weekday. Therefore, in general, the Jovian year and the weekday given in the epigraphs should not be considered as primary verifiable details. In fact, the Œaka year, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse and nakœatra referred to must be considered as primary verifiable details of epigraphs and other verifiable details have to be reconciled with reference to the maximum number of primary verifiable details of epigraphs found satisfactory in the chronology of a particular dynasty. Interestingly, JF Fleet accepted many epigraphs in which the given Jovian year or weekday is not regular. The inconsistency in his approach indicates that Fleet was not comfortable with the early Œaka year given in Mudyanur grant. It is evident that Fleet applied different yardsticks for the epigraphs dated prior to the 6th century CE and the epigraphs dated from 6th century onwards, clearly exposing his fraudulent slant in not accepting authentic and bonafide Indian epigraphs of antiquity. The KadaÚba Dynasty The KadaÚba dynasty was founded by MayÂraœarman in the beginning of the 5th Century BCE. He was the descendant of a South Indian BrÀhmaõa family “HÀrÁti” and belonged to the “MÀnavya” gotra. The rulers of this family were called KadaÚbas as they took special care of a “KadaÚba” tree blossoming near their house. The KadaÚbas were the one of the earliest rulers of the Kuntala region (North-west of KarõÀtaka) and VanavÀsi (also called as VaijayantÁ) was their capital. The Talagunda (SthÀnakundura) pillar inscription172 narrates the history of the KadaÚba dynasty. “Once MayÂraœarman, along with his teacher Viraœarman went to the capital of the Pallavas (KÀðchipuram) in order to complete his Vedic studies. There he had a fierce quarrel with a Pallava official who was riding a horse (tatra PallavÀœva-saÚsthena kalabhena tÁvreõa roÈitaÍ). He was enraged by the helplessness of BrÀhmaõas against Kœatriyas and decided to adopt the life of a Kœatriya. He overpowered the Pallava guards of the frontier and occupied the inaccessible forests around Œriparvata (Œriœailam in Kurnool District). He established himself as the\n77 powerful ruler of the area and also levied tribute on the BÀõa king BÃhad BÀõa. The Pallavas sent an army to eliminate him but he inflicted heavy losses on them. Ultimately, the Pallavas accepted him as an ally and recognised him as the king of a territory between Amara Ocean (Western Ocean) and Premara country (unidentifiable, but very likely, an eastern landmark).” Thus, the BrÀhmaõa MayÂraœarman became a Kœatriya MayÂravarman and founded the kingdom of the KadaÚba dynasty. Only the Candravalli inscription175 written in MahÀrÀÈtrÁ Prakrit belong to the reign of Mayurasarman. He was succeeded by his son Kaôgavarman. BhagÁratha, the son of Kaôgavarman, had two sons, Raghu and KÀkustha. The Halsi plates of YuvarÀja KÀkusthavarman I176 are dated in the eightieth victorious year. Probably, the 80th year was counted from the commencement of MayÂravarman’s reign. KÀkusthavarman I became a powerful ruler and married off his daughters to the royal families of the Guptas and other dynasties. It appears that he was a contemporary of MÀdhavagupta and his son °dityasena of the Krishnagupta dynasty (wrongly identified as the Later Guptas). The ShÀhpur inscription of °dityasena is dated in Œri Harsha era 66 (391 BCE) considering the epoch of Œri Harsha era in 457 BCE. We will discuss the Œri Harsha era in",

It is also recorded in the inscription that KÀkusthavarman I constructed a great tank near a Œiva temple of SthÀnakundura at which, ŒÀtakarõi (probably, Chutu ŒÀtakarõi kings) and other kings had worshipped. The recently unearthed Gudnapur inscription177 tells us that Viraœarman was the grandfather of MayÂravarman. MÃgeœavarman I was the son of ŒÀntivarman I who married the daughter of the king of Kekaya. Ravivarman I was the son of MÃgeœa who killed the king ViÈõudÀsa (nihatya ViÈõudÀsam). This inscription also mentions the NÁtiœÀstra (ArthaœÀstra) of ViÈõugupta. Interestingly, this inscription is a grant to “KÀmadevÀlaya” and refers to “Madanotsava” (festival of love) during the season of Vasanta. “KÀmadevÀyatana” in MÃccÍakaÇikam of SÂdraka and “KÀmadevagÃha” in KÀdambarÁ of BÀõabhaÇÇa also indicate the existence of such social institutions. The Gudnapur inscription probably carries the earliest reference to “KÀmadevÀlaya”. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n78 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the KadaÚbas up to Ravivarman I: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE MayÂraœarman 103-123 480-460 BCE Kaôgavarman 123-143 460-440 BCE BhagÁratha 143-163 440-420 BCE Raghu 163-173 420-410 BCE KÀkusthavarman I 173-203 410-380 BCE ŒÀntivarman I 203-223 380-360 BCE MÃgeœavarman I 223-243 360-340 BCE Ravivarman I 243-268 340-315 BCE The AmmÀnikÀ grant of ŒÀntivarman II178 tells us that Œarvavarman, who was born in the dynasty of MayÂraœarman, became the king and thereafter, his son SiÚhavarman I took over the reins. ŒÀntivarman II, the son of SiÚhavarman I, issued the AmmÀnikÀ grant in Œaka 232 (352- 351 BCE) elapsed and in his 7th regnal year (DvÀtriÚœaduttara-dviœateÈu Œaka-varÈeÈvatÁteÈu pravardhamÀna-vijaya-rÀjya-saÚvatsare saptame varttamÀne VanavÀsyÀm adhivasati vijayaskandhÀvÀre ŒrÀvaõa-sita- dvÀdaœyÀm). Thus, ŒÀntivarman II ascended the throne in Œaka 226 (358- 357 BCE). Historians rejected the AmmÀnikÀ grant because Œaka 232 cannot be accommodated in the distorted chronology of the KadaÚbas. In fact, they are ignorant of the Œaka era that commenced in 583 BCE. Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE Œarvavarman 203-213 380-370 BCE SiÚhavarman I 213-226 370-357 BCE ŒÀntivarman II 226-258 357-325 BCE The subsequent grants of the KadaÚbas tell us that another KÀkusthavarman or KÀkusthavarman II had two sons, ŒÀntivarman III & Krishnavarman I and also a daughter who was married off to the Gaôga king MÀdhava II (304-259 BCE). Krishnavarman I became a powerful ruler in DakœiõÀpatha and one of the most influential ruler of the KadaÚbas. the Gaôga king AvinÁta (258-194 BCE) proudly recorded in his grants that he was the son of the beloved sister of Krishnavarman I. Krishnavarman I had two sons namely ViÈõuvarman and Devavarman. According to the BÀlÀghÀt plates,179 the VÀkÀÇaka king\n79 Narendrasena married Ajjhita BhaÇÇÀrikÀ, a daughter of the lord of Kuntala. The lord of Kuntala referred to was very likely ViÈõuvarman. In the Birur grant,180 ViÈõuvarman tells us that ŒÀntivarman III was the elder brother of his father Krishnavarman I. SiÚhavarman II was the son of ViÈõuvarman and Krishnavarman II was the son of SiÚhavarman II. The Bannahalli grant181 of Krishnavarman II was issued in his 7th regnal year and on the 5th tithi of œukla pakœa of KÀrttika month and JyeÈÇha nakœatra. The Tagare grant182 tells us that Ajavarman was the son of Krishnavarman II, Bhogivarman was the son of Ajavarman and ViÈõuvarman II was the son of Bhogivarman. MÃgeœavarman was the eldest son of ŒÀntivarman III. Of seven dated inscriptions of MÃgeœavarman, three are dated in an old tradition that was in vogue till the first half of the 4th century BCE. The study of the inscriptions of MÃgeœavarman reveals the following: Inscriptions of MÃgeœavarman I (Genealogy not given): 1. 2nd Regnal 10th day of fourth pakœa (fortnight) Written by year183 of Hemanta. Naravara SenÀpati 2. 4th Regnal Full moon day of eighth fortnight Written by year184 of VarÈÀ (Rainy season). Naravara SenÀpati 3. 6th Regnal Full moon day of fourth fortnight Written by year185 of Hemanta. KÁrtivara 4. 7th Regnal 10th day of bright fortnight of Written by year186 MÀrgaœÁrÈa month. KÁrtivara Inscriptions of MÃgeœavarman II (The son of ŒÀntivarman and the grandson of KÀkustha): 5. 3rd regnal In PauÈa saÚvatsara, on 10th tithi Written by year187 of the dark fortnight of KÀrttika DharmakÁrti month and UttarabhadrÀ nakœatra. Bhojaka 6. 8th Regnal On the full moon day of VaiœÀkha Not mentioned year188 month. 7. 8th Regnal In VaiœÀkha saÚvatsara, on the full Name of DharmakÁrti year189 moon day of KÀrttika month. Bhojaka mentioned. MÃgeœavarman, the author of inscriptions 1 to 4 does not mention his father’s name or genealogy whereas MÃgeœavarman, the author of inscriptions 5 to 7 mentions that he is the son of ŒÀntivarman and the grandson of KÀkustha. Moreover, the names of the engravers of the THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n80 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA inscriptions also do not match. Thus, MÃgeœavarman of inscriptions 1 to 4 was a different person and flourished before the MÃgeœavarman of inscriptions 5 to 7. Probably, MÃgeœavarman I reigned around 360-340 BCE. It appears that ŒÀntivarman III’s elder son MÃgeœavarman II started ruling during the reign of his uncle Krishnavarman I. Ravivarman II, the son of MÃgeœavarman II, ruled for more than 35 years. The Ajjibal- Sirsi plates190 of Ravivarman II are dated in his 35th regnal year. Harivarman was the son of Ravivarman II. The Sangoli grant191 of Harivarman was issued in his 8th regnal year and on the occasion of SÀyana TulÀ saÚkrÀnti (viÈuva) and the new moon day of °œvayuja month which regularly corresponds to 16th September 141 BCE. The Halsi grant192 of Harivarman was issued in his 5th regnal year at the request of the Sendraka king BhÀnuœakti. One grant of NikumbhÀllaœakti,193 the grandson of BhÀnuœakti is dated in Kalachuri year 404 (0-1 CE). Therefore, the date of BhÀnuœakti can be fixed around 145-90 BCE. It may be noted that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403 BCE.\n81 Except the AmmÀnikÀ grant, none of the grants of the early KadaÚbas refers to the Œaka era. Therefore, we have no other option but to derive the chronology of the Early KadaÚbas based on the inputs mentioned above. The chronology of the KadaÚbas given here is based entirely on the dates of KÀkusthavarman’s 1st regnal year (80th year from MayÂraœarman), ŒÀntivarman I’s 7th regnal year (Œaka 232), the Gaôga king MÀdhava II (293-259 BCE), AvinÁta (258-194 BCE) and the Sendraka king BhÀnuœakti (145-90 BCE). MÀndhÀtÃvarman,194 the son of KumÀravarman, also ruled for some time, and so did Madhuvarman195 and DÀmodara196 but not much information is available in the inscriptions. The early Chalukya king KÁrtivarman I invaded VanavÀsi in the second half of the 2nd century BCE bringing the rule of the KadaÚba dynasty came to an end. The KadaÚbas could not re-establish themselves due to the rise of the early Chalukyas of Badami and subsequently the rise of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. It appears that a branch of the KadaÚbas were ruling in Goa around the 4th century CE. Two grants of Jayakeœi I are dated in the Œaka era and not the ŒÀlivÀhana era. The Panjim grant197 of Jayakeœi I was issued in Œaka 981 (397-398 CE) [Candra-vasu-graha-nimite œÀke varÈe vikÀriõi prÀpte, °ÈÀçha-kÃÈõa-pakœe vÀre œaœalakœmaõas-tathÀÈÇamyÀm |]. Raya viragal198 of Jayakeœi I was written in Œaka 993 (409-410 CE), VirodhikÃt saÚvatsara and on the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight of JyeÈÇha month, Monday, on the occasion of SaÚkramaõa. Considering Œaka 993 elapsed, THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA KÀkusthavarman II Œaka 268-303 (315-280 BCE) Œaka era In CE (583 BCE) Krishnavarman I 323-353 260-230 BCE ViÈõuvarman II 353-378 230-205 BCE SiÚhavarman II 378-401 205-182 BCE Krishnavarman II 402-423 181-160 BCE Ajavarman 423-448 160-135 BCE Bhogivarman 448-468 135-115 BCE ViÈõuvarman II 468? 115?

This date cannot be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. The Pallava Dynasty The Pallavas were the one of the earliest rulers of South India. Unfortunately, Pallava inscriptions are dated only in regnal years. We have to rely on references in other inscriptions to construct the chronology of the Pallava dynasty. It is well known that the rise of Pallavas ended the rule of IkœvÀku dynasty in the lower Andhra regions. The earliest inscriptions of the Pallavas are written in PrÀkrit. Thus, the early Pallava inscriptions must be dated in the 6th century BCE. SiÚhavarman I was the earliest known ruler of the Pallavas and his likely contemporaries were MayÂraœarman, the founder of the KadaÚba dynasty and Koôgani Varman, the founder of the Gaôga dynasty. His son, Œivaskandavarman succeeded him. The Penukonda grant199 of the Gaôga king MÀdhava SiÚhavarman tells us that the Pallava king SiÚhavarman coronated the Gaôga king °ryavarman, the son of MÀdhavavarman I and later, the Pallava king Skandavarman coronated MÀdhava SiÚhavarman, the son of °ryavarman. The Allahabad pillar inscription200 of Samudragupta mentions ViÈõugopa as the ruler of KÀðchi. The Hoskote grant201 of AvinÁta mentions the Pallava king SiÚhavishnu (SiÚhaViÈõu- pallavÀdhirÀja-jananyÀ). The Jain scholar SiÚhasÂri translated “LokavibhÀga”, a Jain work on cosmology into Sanskrit on BhÀdrapada AmÀvÀsyÀ of Œaka 380 (23rd August 204 BCE) during the 22nd regnal year of the Pallava king SiÚhavarman. SaÚvatsare tu dvaviÚœe KÀðchÁœa-SiÚhavarmanaÍ | AœÁtyagre ŒakÀbdÀnÀm siddhametaccÍata-traye || 202 LokavibhÀga was originally written in Prakrit by the Jain monk Sarvanandi around the 6th century BCE. Interestingly, LokavibhÀga expresses the number 13,107,200,000 in reverse order as 00000 2 7 0 1 3 1 “PaðcabhyaÍ khalu œÂnyebhyaÍ param dvi sapta cÀmbaram ekam trÁõi ca rÂpam ca” which indicates that the decimal place-value system and the use of zero were well established in India much before the 6th century BCE.\n83 According to “AvantisundarÁkathÀ”, a Sanskrit work of Dançin, BhÀravi met the Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana (JayasiÚha I or Pulakeœin I) and thereafter the Gaôga king DurvinÁta. Later, he also met the Pallava king SiÚhavishnu in his capital KÀðchi. The IndrapÀlanagara copper plate inscription203 of the ViÈõukunçin king Vikramendra- BhaÇÇÀrakavarman was issued in Œaka 488 (95 BCE) in his 22nd regnal year in which the ViÈõukunçin king claimed victory over the Pallava king SiÚha. the Manne grant204 of Gaôga king MÀrasiÚha tells us that the Gaôga king ŒivamÀradeva was coronated by the Pallava king Nandivarman and the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king GovindarÀja. Based on these inputs, the chronology of the Pallavas can be deduced as under: Œaka era In CE (583 BCE) SiÚhavarman I 83-108 500-475 BCE (Œiva) Skandavarman I 108-138 475-445 BCE KumÀravishnu (Elder son of Skandavarman I) 138-163 445-420 BCE SiÚhavarman II(Younger son of Skandavarman I who coronated the Gaôga king °ryavarman) 163-173 420-410 BCE Skandavarman II(who coronated the Gaôga king MÀdhava SiÚhavarman) 173-203 410-380 BCE Viravarman 203-218 380-365 BCE Skandavarman II 218-248 365-335 BCE SiÚhavarman III 248-278 335-305 BCE ViÈõugopavarman (who fought against Samudragupta) 253-283 330-300 BCE The following kings were the probable descendents of ViÈõugopavarman SiÚhavishnu I (contemporary to the Gaôga king AvinÁta) 323-358 260-225 BCE SiÚhavarman (SiÚhasÂri translated “LokavibhÀga” in his 22nd regnal year) 358-403 225-180 BCE SiÚhavishnu II (BhÀravi met him in KÀðchi) 403-443 180-140 BCE THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n84 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA SiÚha?(who was defeated by ViÈõukunçin king) 443-488 140-95 BCE Nandivarman (a descendant of SiÚhavarman III and the one who coronated Gaôga king ŒivamÀradeva) 703-733 120-150 BCE Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi The early Chalukyas of Badami were dethroned by the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas around Œaka 680 (97 CE). After two centuries, it appears that the descendants of the early Chalukyas defeated RÀÈÇrakÂÇas and re- established the kingdom of the Western Chalukyas in the beginning of the 4th century CE. Tailapa °havamalla was the founder of the Western Chalukyas. The Nilgund inscription205 tells us that Tailapa °havamalla defeated the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas to establish his kingdom (Yo’sau œri-vÁramÀrttÀnda- RÀÈÇrakÂÇa-nÃpa-œriyam prÀpya pÀlitavÀn SamrÀçeka-ccÍatreõa medinÁm). He also defeated the Choça-Andhra, PÀnçya and Utkala kings. °havamalla appears to have engaged in a conflict with RÀjarÀja Choça due to his interference in the Veôgi Kingdom. The Nilgunda inscription is dated in Œaka 904 (Œaka-nÃpa-saÚvatsareÈu caturadhika-navaœateÈu gateÈu ChitrabhÀnu- saÚvatsare BhÀdrapadamÀse sÂryagrahaõe sati). A solar eclipse occurred in Œaka 904 current (320-321 CE) on 18th October 320 CE but the month was °svina and not BhÀdrapada according to modern Indian calendar. The Saundatti inscription206 of Tailapadeva is dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 902 (980 CE) [Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œatangal 902 neya Vikrama- saÚvatsarada PauÈya œuddha daœamÁ bÃhaspativÀradandi-nuttarÀyaõa]. It is evident that °havamalla Tailapa of the Nilgund inscription and Tailapa of the Saundatti inscription were two different persons. Moreover, the Nilgund inscription is written in Sanskrit and old Kannada characters whereas Saundatti inscription is written in Kannada and mediaeval Kannada characters. Thus, Tailapadeva of the Saundatti inscription appears to have re-established the kingdom of the Western Chalukyas around 980 CE. Evidently, the Chalukya dynasty ruled mainly in three phases. \u0002 Phase I : Chalukyas of Badami – from 225 BCE to 97 CE \u0002 Phase II: Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi – from the beginning of the 4th century CE till the end of the 5th century CE.\n85 \u0002 Phase III: Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi – from 980 CE till the end of the 12th century CE. The Miraj plates of Jagadekamalla,207 the Tintini plates of Jagadekamalla,208 the Narihalla plates of Trailokyamalla209 and the Yewur inscription of Tribhuvanamalla210 chronicle the genealogy of Western Chalukyas. Generally, the genealogy of a dynasty contains only a listing of the sovereign rulers. The Chalukya genealogy given in these inscriptions simply skips the account of a dark period by stating “tataÍ” mean thereafter instead of “tat-sutaÍ or tadÀtmajaÍ”. For instance, “Tato’pi YuddhamallÀkhyo” and “Taila-bhÂpas-tato jÀto”. More than 500 inscriptions of the Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi have been published in various volumes of South Indian Inscriptions. Surprisingly, more than half of the solar eclipses mentioned in these inscriptions cannot be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. The percentage of the number of irregular solar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions dated in the Chalukya Vikrama era is even higher (see Appendix VI). Something is seriously wrong in the chronology of the Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi as given by modern historians. There is a need to refer to the original text (unedited) of inscriptions to ascertain the actual verifiable details of the dates without any prejudice to a particular chronology. The chronology of the Western Chalukyas can only be reconstructed after proper identification of inscriptions dated in the Œaka and ŒÀlivÀhana eras. Interestingly, most of the inscriptions of the Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi were written in the Kannada language. Generally, the same expression “ŒakavarÈa.... neya” has been used to refer to the Œaka era or ŒÀlivÀhana era which complicates the identification of the era referred to in these inscriptions. Very few inscriptions mentioned “Œaka-nÃpa- kÀlÀtÁta” which clearly refers to the ŒÀlivÀhana era. It appears that the word “ŒÀlivÀhana” was attached to the Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era in the 9th century CE to eliminate the confusion between Œaka era and ŒÀlivÀhana era. Interestingly, an inscription211 at Lakœmeœvar in DhÀrwar district, written both in Sanskrit and Kannada, records the dates of the death of Œrinaõdi Pançita and the death of BhÀskaranandi Pançita by the rite of Sallekhana and clearly states that BhÀskaranandi was senior to Œrinandi. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n86 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The date of the death of Œrinandi Pançita: In Sanskrit: “BhÂte ŒakÀbdajÀte nava-nava-nava Œri-VikramÀôke dvitÁye, Œvete pakœe ÀjðÀvÀre dinapa-mita-dine Piôgale Œukra-mÀse” In Kannada: “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsaram [galum] baynura- tombatombatagi (999) VikramÀbhudaya-derade-neya Piôgala-saÚvatsara- dashadha-œuddha-dvÀdaœi budhava-dandu......” The date of the death of BhÀskaranandi Pançita: In Sanskrit: “SÀhasrÁÈu gatÀsu ŒÀkasamaye Chaitrasya kÃÈõe caturdaœyÀm kÀlayuji....” In Kannada: “SahasrÀntika Œaka-kÀla-yuktÀbda madu-masÀvasÀnadol amÀvÀsiyu-mÀdityavÀramumÀga..........” It is evident that BhÀskaranandi died in Œaka-kÀla-yuktÀbda 1000 whereas Œrinandi died in Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta 999. Apparently, these two dates refer to two different eras. The author of the inscription intended to distinguish between two different eras by expressing “Œaka-kÀla- yuktÀbda” for the Œaka era (583 BCE) and “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara” for the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Therefore, Œaka-kÀla-yuktÀbda refers to the Œaka era (583 BCE) whereas Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta refers to the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Thus, BhÀskaranandi died in Œaka 1000 (12th / 13th April 416 CE) whereas Œrinandi died in ŒÀlivÀhana 999 (12th June 1076 CE). This inscription of Lakœmeœvar unambiguously indicates the existence of two eras i.e. Œaka-kÀlayukta era and Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta era. The Kashmiri poet Bilhaõa (370-450 CE) was in the court of the Chalukya king VikramÀditya and authored a MahÀkÀvya named VikramÀôkadevacaritam. The date of Bilhaõa will be discussed in",

    "content": "with reference to Chalukya Vikrama SaÚvat. According to him, Tailapa defeated the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas and re-established the Chalukya kingdom. The Nilgund inscription of Tailapa is dated in Œaka 904 (320 CE). SatyÀœraya succeeded him. Thereafter, JayasiÚha and his son °havamalla Trailokyamalla became kings. Bilhaõa mentions that °havamalla Trailokyamalla defeated the king of DhÀrÀ. °havamalla Trailokyamalla had three sons, named Someœvara, VikramÀditya and JayasiÚha. VikramÀditya Tribhuvanamalla, the second son of °havamalla Trailokyamalla, was the nÀyaka (hero) of VikramÀôkadevacaritam written\n87 by Bilhaõa. The Kotavumachgi inscription of Tribhuvanamalla VikramÀditya is dated in Œaka 934 (350-351 CE).212 Interestingly, the Œri Chalukyaraja AyyanavaÚœa Caritam written by ŒyÀmabhaÇÇa BharadvÀja in Œaka 1737 (1154 CE?) also gives the complete genealogy of the Western Chalukyas. VV Mirashi discussed about this work in Chapter XXVII of his book “Literary and Historical Studies in Indology”. Evidently, someone fraudulently inserted few verses referring to the names of the Iranian king Khusro and Hiuen Tsang in this work. There is a serious need to relook into the original manuscript of AyyanavaÚœa Caritam but probably, no manuscript is available now. According to Dr. VV Mirashi, this work gives detailed information about the fifty five generations and the long period of 1355 years which elapsed from Œaka 358 till Œaka 1713. Considering the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king (583 BCE), probably, the genealogy may have been given from Œaka 358 (225 BCE) to Œaka 1713 (1130 CE). The chronology of the Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi (Phase II) has to be reconstructed based on VikramÀôkadevacaritam and epigraphic evidence. There were many branches of the later Chalukyas. It is extremely difficult to reconcile the genealogy given by Bilhaõa and the genealogy given in the Miraj plates of Jagadekamalla, the Tintini plates of Jagadekamalla, the Narihalla plates of Trailokyamalla and the Yewur inscription of Tribhuvanamalla. However, I have tried to reconstruct the chronology that can be refined further.

THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n88 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the Western Chalukyas of KalyÀõi (Phase III): Genealogy given in ŒÀlivÀhana In CE Inscriptions era (78 CE) Tailapa II 970-980 CE SatyÀœraya II 980-1000 CE VikramÀditya (Son of DÀsa varmÀ, the youger brother of SatyÀœraya) 1000-1016 CE Jagadekamalla JayasiÚha (Younger brother of VikramÀditya) 938-967 1016-1045 CE °havamalla Trailokyamalla 967-986 1045-1064 CE Bhuvanaikamalla (Son of Trailokyamalla) 986-998 1060-1076 CE VikramÀditya Tribhuvanamalla (Younger brother of Bhuvanaikamalla) 998-1049 1076-1127 CE The YÀdava Dynasty An inscription214 of Govana III found in Khandesh (Jalgaon, Dhule, Nandurbar districts of Maharashtra and Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh) is dated in Œaka 1075 (VarÈÀõÀm paðcasaptasya sahasre sÀdhike gate | Œaka-bhÂpÀla-kÀlasya tathÀ Œrimukha-vatsare || ). It clearly refers to the Œaka era as “Œaka-bhÂpÀla-kÀla” (583 BCE) and not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Therefore, this inscription was written in 491-492 CE (Œaka 1075). The Patna inscription215 found near Chalisgaon in Khandesh was authored by Soideva and HemÀdideva, the sons of Govana III in Œaka 1128 (544-545 CE) during the reign of the YÀdava king Siôghaõa. This inscription was written on the full moon day of ŒrÀvaõa month and on the occasion of a lunar eclipse. Considering the Œaka 1128 current or elapsed, the date intended would be 6th September 545 CE. The month is not ŒrÀvaõa but °œvina which needs verification from the original text of the inscription. Interestingly, the Patna inscription mentions ChÀôgadeva, the chief astrologer of the YÀdava king Siôghaõa. ChÀôgadeva was the grandson of the famous Bhaskaracharya who was born in Œaka 1036 (452-453 CE) [Rasa-guõa-pÂrõa-mahÁ-sama-Œaka-nÃpa-samaye’bhavan-mamotpattiÍ].126 Alberuni (1030 CE) mentions Bhaskaracharya and his book “Karaõa\n89 KutÂhala” as a work of astronomy known in his own country for over a hundred years. It is evident that Bhaskaracharya was born much before Alberuni. ŒÀrôgadeva authored “SaôgÁtaratnÀkara” during the reign of the YÀdava king Siôghaõa. He mentions about YÀdava kings Bhillama, Siôghaõa and also the city of Jaitra.217 Bhilama’s son Jaitugi was also titled “JaitrapÀla” meaning a king ruling the city of Jaitra. The Jaðjira grant (set I & II issued in ŒÀlivÀhana 915)218 of SilÀhÀra AparÀjita mentioned Khandesh as “BhillamÁya deœa” (À LÀtadeœÀd bhuvi Bhillamiyadeœam vidhÀyÀvadhimÀtra yasya). Khandesh was well known as BhillamÁya deœa because Bhillama founded the YÀdava kingdom in Khandesh in the 6th century CE. Bhillama I was the first YÀdava king and the founder of the YÀdava dynasty in the 6th century CE. He ruled from Œaka 1107 to Œaka 1114 (523-530 CE). His son Jaitugi or JaitrapÀla I succeeded him and ruled from Œaka 1114 to Œaka 1124 (530-540 CE). The great YÀdava king Siôghaõa, the son of JaitrapÀla I, ruled for 45 years from Œaka 1124 to Œaka 1169 (540-585 CE). He defeated King Ballala, King of Andhra, Kakkalla the king of BhaÚbhÀgiri and imprisoned the ŒilÀhÀra King Bhoja. The Puruœottampuri grant219 of the YÀdava king RÀmachandra informs us that Krishna, the grandson of Siôghaõa and the son of JaitrapÀla II, became king in Œaka 1169 (585-586 CE). It appears that Krishna subjugated the kings of Gurjara, MÀlava, Chola and Kosala (Re Re Gurjara jarjara....... bhÂpÀ yadvijaya-prayÀõa-samaye bandÁjana-vyaôjanÀÍ). After the death of Krishna, his younger brother MahÀdeva ascended the throne. According to the Kalegaon grant220 of MahÀdeva, he was coronated on the 2nd tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in Saka 1182 elapsed (599-600 CE) i.e. 29th / 30th July 599 CE. MahÀdeva’s son Ammaõa succeeded him but the Puruœottampuri grant tells us that Krishna’s son RÀmachandra forcibly wrested the kingdom from Ammaõa (prasahya tasmÀdapahÃtya bhuôkte). RÀmachandra ruled for more than 40 years from Œaka 1193 (609-610 CE) to Œaka 1232 (649-650 CE). The chronology of the YÀdava dynasty: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE Bhillama 1107-1114 523-530 CE JaitrapÀla I or Jaitugi 1114-1124 530-540 CE THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n90 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Siôghaõa 1124-1169 541-585 CE Krishna 1169-1182 585-599 CE MahÀdeva 1183-1192 599-609 CE Ammaõa 1192-1193 609-610 CE RÀmachandra 1193-1233 610-650 CE Puruœottampuri grant tells us that King RÀmachandra was the greatest ruler of the YÀdava dynasty. RÀmachandra vanquished the king of the great, extensive ÷Àhala country within a moment (YenottÀla-viœÀla- ÷Àhala-mahÁpÀlaÍ kœaõÀnnirjito....) and defeated the ruler of the country of BhÀnçÀgÀra (BhÀnçÀgÀra-dharÀdhavaÍ paribhavam yenoccakairlaÚbhitaÍ.....). He subjugated the king of VajrÀkara (YenonmÂlitarÀjya eva racito VajrÀkara-ksmÀpati....) and conquered the King of Gopa (YenÀjau vijitaÍ sa GopanÃpatir....) & the king of Palli (BhallÁbhiÍ PallirÀjaÍ samarabhuvi jitaÍ....). He also defeated the king of KÀnyakubja (KubjitaÍ KÀnyakubjaÍ), the king of MÀhima (MÀhimendraÍ parÀstaÍ) and captured by force the mighty king of Saôgama (UttuôgaÍ SaôgameœaÍ prasabhamadhigato) and crushed the lord of KheÇa (KheÇanÀtho yena svenaiva dhÀmnÀ....). He abrogated the conventional rules about tolls, exempted all ÀgrahÀras from taxes, freed VÀrÀõasi from MleccÍas and constructed a golden temple of ŒÀrôgadhara (Yah œulka-sanketalipim vyalopayat sarvÀgrahÀreœhu karÀn nyavÀrayat, VÀrÀnasÁm MleccÍagaõÀd vyamocayad hiraõmayam ŒÀrôgadharÀlayam vyadhÀt). RÀmachandra claimed himself to be Prauçha-pratÀpa-chakravarti and MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja. The Puruœottamapuri grant refers to the date as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta- saÚvatsareÈu dvÀtriÚœadadhika-dvÀdaœa-œata-saôkhyÀkeÈu sÀdhÀraõa- saÚvatsarÀntargata-BhÀdrapada-œuklaikÀdaœyÀm” i.e. on the 11th tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month and 1232 years elapsed in the era of Œaka king (649-650 CE). The date corresponds to 23rd /24th Aug 649 CE. The compound word “kÀlÀtÁta” used here is a Saptami tatpuruÈa (kÀle atÁtÀÍ) not DvitÁyÀ tatpuruÈa (kÀlam atÁtÀÍ). Therefore, we must translate it here as “1232 years elapsed in the era of Œaka king” and not as “1232 years from the end of the era of Œaka king”. Since historians are ignorant of the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king (583 BCE), they mistakenly identified RÀm Dev or RÀi RÀyÀn, the king of Devagiri mentioned in Muslim chronicles to be RÀmachandra\n91 of the PuruÈottampuri grant and concluded that the grant was dated in SÀlivÀhana 1232 elapsed (1310-1311 CE) and issued on 5th Sep 1310 CE. It is well known that Alauddin Khilji, the second ruler of the Khilji dynasty was reigning at Delhi around 1296-1316 CE and it is also recorded in Muslim chronicles that RÀm Dev, the king of Devagiri, was paying tribute to Delhi Sultanate since 1296 CE. If RÀm Dev were to be RÀmachandra, how can a tribute-paying petty king of Devagiri claim to be the Prauçha- pratÀpa-chakravarti, MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and how can all his victories over the kings of ÷Àhala, KÀnyakubja (Kanauj), VÀrÀõasi etc. be explained when the powerful Delhi Sultanate headed by Balban and the Khilji dynasty was reigning over the whole of North India up to the NarmadÀ River. According to Muslim chronicles like Futuh-us-Salatin of Isami, Tarikh- i-Firuzshahi of Ziauddin Barani and Tarikh-i-Firishta of Firishta, Alauddin was the Governor of Kaça when he received the information about the fabulous wealth of Devagiri. Under the prevailing political circumstances, Alauddin wanted to plunder the wealth of Devagiri to fulfil his ambition of ascending the throne of Delhi. He conducted a plundering raid on Devagiri and acquired wealth beyond his expectation. RÀm Dev, the King of Devagiri, agreed to send the yearly revenue of Illichpur as annual tribute to Alauddin and he also gave in marriage one of his daughters to Alauddin. In return, Alauddin handed over the Devagiri kingdom back to RÀm Dev and returned only two elephants to him. Thus, Alauddin not only made RÀm Dev, a militarily impotent king but also ensured a permanent source of income for himself. Later, Alauddin killed his uncle Jalaluddin and ascended the throne of Delhi in 1296 CE. Therefore, RÀm Dev of Devagiri was reduced to a feudatory of the Khiljis well before 1296 CE. In 1303 CE, Alauddin sent his army led by Malik Juna Dad Bak and Malik Jhaju to conquer WÀrangal, the capital of the KÀkatÁya dynasty. The KÀkatÁya King PratÀpa Rudradeva II comprehensively defeated the army of Alauddin. Inspired by the victory of PratÀpa Rudradeva II, the Devagiri king RÀm Dev stopped paying his annual tributes to Delhi in 1306 CE. Alauddin sent his commander Malik Kafur, a converted Hindu eunuch, who defeated RÀm Dev and sent him to Delhi where he stayed as guest for about six months. RÀm Dev agreed to pay the annual tribute regularly and returned to Devagiri. Thus, RÀm Dev not only became loyal to the Khiljis but also supplied a contingent of MarÀtha solders as THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n92 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA reinforcements to the army of Alauddin when Malik Kafur attacked WÀrangal. According to Tarikh-i-Alai of Amir KhusrÂ, Malik Kafur started on 25th Jamadi I 709 A.H. i.e. 31st Oct 1309 CE from Delhi on the expedition to capture the fort of WÀrangal. Malik Kafur succeeded in capturing the fort of WÀrrangal around 13th Ramzan 709 A.H. i.e. March 1310 CE. Ultimately, PratÀpa Rudradeva II agreed to pay annual tribute to the Khiljis and handed over the treasure of the KÀkatÁyas including the famous Koh-i-noor diamond. As directed by Alauddin, a large army led by Malik Kafur and KhvÀjÀ HÀji passed through Devagiri in the course of an expedition against the Hoyasala ruler of DwÀrasamudra around 13th Ramzan 710 A.H. i.e. 3rd Feb 1311 CE. According to Amir Khusru, Ram Dev or Rai Rayan helped the army of Alauddin but Barani and Firishta state that when Malik Kafur and HÀji reached Devagiri they found that RÀm Dev was dead. It appears that RÀm Dev died around Feb /Mar 1311 CE. Malik Kafur subjugated the king of DwÀrasamudra by 18th Siawal 710 A.H. i.e. 10th March 1311 CE and marched towards Madurai, the kingdom of the PÀndyas. Malik Kafur reached as far as RÀmeœwaram and returned to Delhi on 18th Oct 1311 with 612 elephants, 96,000 maunds of gold, 20,000 horses and several chests of precious jewels and pearls. After the death of RÀm Dev, his eldest son Siôghaõadeva or Œankaradeva became the king of Devagiri. It appears that he stopped paying his annual tribute to Delhi in 711 A.H. i.e. 1312 CE and once again, Malik Kafur was again sent to Devagiri, where in the ensuing war, Siôghaõadeva (Œankaradeva?) was killed. Thus, Devagiri became a part of the Delhi Sultanate and Malik Kafur was appointed Governor. On the insistence of Alauddin, Malik Kafur had to hand over the kingdom of Devagiri to HarapÀladeva, a prince of the YÀdava dynasty in 1315 CE and return to Delhi. HarapÀladeva also was killed around 1318 CE and ultimately, Devagiri became Daulatabad during the rule of Tuglak dynasty. It is evident that RÀm Dev cannot be identified with the RÀmachandra of the Puruœottampuri grant. RÀm Dev lost his ancestral wealth to Alauddin around 1295 CE and regularly paid annual tribute to Alauddin from 1295 CE till his death in 1311 CE. It is totally absurd to accept that the hapless RÀm Dev could claim to be the Prauçha-pratÀpa-\n93 chakravarti, MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and refer to his great victories on ÷Àhala, KÀnyakubja and VÀrÀõasi while he was attending on Malik Kafur on his expedition to DwÀrasamudra. None of the Muslim chronicles ever mention the victories of RÀm Dev. Therefore, RÀmachandra’s Puruœottampuri grant was issued in Saka 1232 (649-650 CE) and not in ŒÀlivÀhana 1232 (1310 CE). It appears that RÀmachandra, who flourished in the 7th century CE, was the greatest king of the YÀdava dynasty, even greater than King Siôghaõa. A list of important inscriptions of the Yadava dynasty is provided in Appendix VII. The verifiable details of the solar eclipses mentioned in the Yadava inscriptions: The Nimbal inscription of Bhillama’s Feudatory:221 3rd Regnal year of Billama i.e. Œaka 1110 (526-527 CE), the new moon day of Bhadrapada, Solar eclipse and SaÚkramaõa (TulÀ SaÚkrÀnti). The date corresponds to 22nd Sep 526 CE. The Devur inscription of Jaitugi’s feudatory:222 Œaka 1118 (534-535 CE), solar eclipse during Uttarayana. The date corresponds to 29th Apr 534 CE. The Devangav inscription of Jaitugi’s feudatory:223 Œaka 1121 (537- 538 CE), Solar eclipse on the new moon day of MÀgha month. The date corresponds to 15th Feb 538 CE. The Khedrapur inscription of Singhana:224 Œaka 1136 (554-555 CE), Solar eclipse on the new moon day of Chaitra month. The date corresponds to 19th Mar 554 CE. THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n94 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The Jettigi inscription of Krishna:225 Œaka 1178 (594-595 CE), Solar eclipse on the new moon day of PauÈa month. The date corresponds to 16th Jan 595 CE. The Hulgur inscription of MahÀdeva:226 Œaka 1189 (606-607 CE), Solar eclipse on the new moon day of JyeÈÇha month. The date corresponds to 11th June 606 CE. The rule of the early YÀdava kings probably ended after the death of RÀmachandra due to the rise of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas in 8th century CE. Later, it appears that the YÀdavas became feudatories of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. The Kalas-Bhadruka inscription227 of Bhillama dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 948\n95 (1026 CE) and the Bassein grant of Seunachandra II228 dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 991 (1069 CE) clearly indicate this fact. It also appears that one family branch of the YÀdavas evolved as a mixed YÀdava-RÀÈÇrakÂÇa family. The Bassein grant of Seunachandra II tells us that the YÀdavas also had marital relations with the Western Chalukyas. A manuscript229 collected by Mackenzie gives the list of 18 YÀdava kings who ruled from ŒÀlivÀhana 730 (808 CE) to 1013 (1091 CE). This list needs further research. the Methi inscription of Kannara230 dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 1176 (1254 CE) informs that a YÀdava king Kannara was ruling around 1254 CE. RÀm Dev was probably the son or grandson of Kannara. The genealogy of Later YÀdava kings (ruled from 10th century CE to 1318 CE): 1. DÃçhaprahÀra 2. Seunachandra I 3. Dhadipaka 4. Bhillama II 5.

HarapÀladeva THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n96 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The ŒilÀhÀras of KolhÀpur (KœullakapurÀ) The KolhÀpur family of the ŒilÀhÀras ruled over Southern MahÀrÀÈtra comprising the districts of SatÀrÀ, Sangli, KolhÀpur and Belgaon. The Early Chalukyas (up to 97 CE) and RÀÈÇrakÂÇas (2nd - 3rd century CE) had previously ruled over the region. The Western Chalukyas defeated the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas to re-establish themselves in the early 4th century CE. This family of ŒilÀhÀras rose to power as an ally or a feudatory of the Western Chalukyas in the 4th century CE. Most of the inscriptions of the Kolhapur ŒilÀhÀras are dated in Œaka era (583 BCE) except the Miraj plates of MÀrasiÚha231 which are dated in Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta or ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). All inscriptions of the other families of ŒilÀhÀras are dated in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Thus, the family of the KolhÀpur ŒilÀhÀras was one of the earliest families of the ŒilÀhÀra dynasty. The ŒilÀhÀra dynasty traces its descent from JÁmÂtavÀhana, the son of JÁmÂtaketu. The earliest inscription of this family is the KolhÀpur grant232 of GançarÀditya dated in Œaka 1037 (454 CE) [Sapta-triÚœaduttara-sahasreÈu Œaka-varÈeÈu 1037 atÁteÈu Manmatha-saÚvatsare KÀrttika-mÀse œukla-pakœe aÈÇamyÀm budhavÀre.......]. According to the genealogy of KolhÀpur ŒilÀhÀras given in this grant, Jatiga I was their earliest king who was the maternal uncle of the Gaôga king (probably, MÀrasiÚha GuÇÇÁya Gaôga, the second son of Butuga II who ruled around 287-307 CE). The genealogy of the KolhÀpur ŒilÀhÀras: Jatiga I Nayima or NayimÀôka Candra Jatiga II Goôkala GÂvala I KÁrtirÀja ChandrÀditya MÀrasiÚha GÂvala II Bhojadeva I BallÀladeva GançarÀditya Gaôgadeva VijayÀditya Bhojadeva II\n97 Undoubtedly, the inscriptions of VijayÀditya and Bhojadeva II are dated in the Œaka era (583 BCE). The verifiable details of these inscriptions can be better explained in the Œaka era. The inscrptions of ŒilÀhÀra VijayÀditya: The Kolhapur Stone Inscription:233 Œaka 1065 elapsed (482-483 CE), Dundubhi saÚvatsara, Full moon day of MÀgha month, Monday and a lunar eclipse.

He states that the JÀvÀnese people were Hindus and not Buddhists. This means Indians arrived in South-east Asia much earlier than the 5th century CE. The inscription at Bayang clearly refers to “Œakendra-varÈa” meaning the era of the Œaka king (583 BCE) and not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). The Inscription of IœÀnavarman at Vat Chakret (Cambodia):244 Vat Chakret is an ancient temple situated at the foot of the mountain Ba Phnom.

The Inscription at Mantralaya, Karnool:248 Œaka 815 elapsed (232- 233 CE), PramÀdi saÚvatsara and a solar eclipse.

The Inscription at Otur, Sorab, Shimoga:249 Œaka 861(277-278 CE), Vilambi saÚvatsara, Chaitra œukla pratipadÀ, Wednesday and on the occasion of “Valaya grahaõa” i.e. annular solar eclipse (Œaka-nÃpa- kÀlÀkrÀnta-saÚvatsara-œatamgal...... Valaya-grahaõa....). The date corresponds to 20th February 277 CE and an annular solar eclipse occurred in latitude 12.3 North and longitude 95.7 East. Based on the comprehensive and in-depth study of the inscriptions of the Œaka era as attempted above, it can be unhesitatingly concluded that the Œaka era has two epochs. One era commenced from the coronation of the Œaka king in 583 BCE while the other commenced from\n101 the death of the Œaka king or the end of the rule of the Œaka king in 78 CE. The era that commenced from the coronation of the Œaka king was referred to as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla”, “Œaka-varÈa” etc. and the era that commenced from the death of the Œaka king was referred to as “Œaka- nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta”. The compound word “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara....” has been misinterpreted as “the years elapsed from the era of the Œaka king” considering it Paðcami or Saptami tatpuruÈa compound as “Œaka-nÃpa- kÀlÀt or Œaka-nÃpa-kÀle atÁtÀÍ saÚvatsarÀÍ, teÈu”. Generally, it is DvitÁyÀ tatpuruÈa compound as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlaÚ atÁtÀÍ saÚvatsarÀÍ, teÈu” which means “the years from the end of the era of the Œaka king. In very few instances like the Puruœottampuri plates of the YÀdava king RÀmachandra,250 was the compound “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” used as Paðcami or Saptami tatpuruÈa. The Surat plates of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa karkarÀja251 and the Kauthem plates252 of VikramÀditya expressed the date as “Œaka-nÃpa- kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œateÈu..... atÁteÈu” which is irrefutable evidence that “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” is the compound word of DvitÁyÀ tatpuruÈa and not Paðcami or Saptami tatpuruÈa. The poet Somadeva SÂri also refers to the date of his work “YaœastilakachaÚpÂ” as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara- œateÈvaÈÇasvekÀœÁtyadhikeÈu gateÈu....”i.e. ŒÀlivÀhana 881 (959 CE). It is totally absurd to use “atÁteÈu” or “gateÈu” again in case “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” is Paðcami or Saptami tatpuruÈa compound. The Œaka rulers conquered North-Western India in 6th century BCE and annexed the city of Ujjain, the centre of Indian astronomy. The first Œaka ruler of India enforced the use of the epoch from the date of his coronation i.e. 583 BCE. Gradually, this Œaka era became popular in North-Western India and also in South India. The rule of the Œakas was in decline from the 3rd century BCE onwards and the Œakas were decisively defeated by the 1st century CE. Though the rule of Œakas ended, the use of the Œaka era continued. Around the 1st century CE, Indian astronomers were in search of a perfect new epoch replacing the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE) because they found that the epoch of 583 BCE is not suitable for accurate and all-round astronomical calculations. They also wanted to replace the epoch of the Œaka king to get rid of the legacy of a tyrant MleccÍa king. Therefore, Indian astronomers introduced the epoch of 78 CE and named it as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” to commemorate the end of the Œaka era or the death of the Œaka king. Since the KÀrttikÀdi calendar was in vogue in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE), THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n102 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Indian astronomers also replaced it with the ChaitrÀdi calendar and reset the epoch in 57 BCE considering 135 years gap to the epoch of 78 CE. Thus, Indian astronomers introduced the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era with the epoch of 57 BCE and linked it to the victory of VikramÀditya, king of Ujjain, over the Œakas. Gradually, the Vikrama era (57 BCE) became popular in North India and the Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta era (78 CE) became popular in South India from the 8th century CE onwards. Indians forgot the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE) in due course of time. Moreover, the use of the same expressions “ŒakavarÈa....... neya” etc. for Œaka era and Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era in Kannada inscriptions has complicated the problem of distinguishing between these two eras. When Alberuni visited India in 11th century CE, Indians generally knew only one epoch of Œaka era i.e. the death of Œaka king in 78 CE. In the 9th century CE, astronomers introduced a prefix “ŒÀlivÀhana”, probably, the name of a king of PratiÈÇhÀna who played a major role in the elimination of the Œakas, in order to distinguish clearly the Œaka-kÀlÀtÁta era (78 CE) from the Œaka era (583 BCE) but the prefix “ŒÀlivÀhana” became popular only after the 11th century CE. In fact, the death of the Œaka king or the end of the Œaka era was the real epoch of the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Udayana, the author of “LakœaõÀvati”, a work on logic in the year ŒÀlivÀhana 906 (984 CE), also confirmed that the epoch of 78 CE was the death of the Œaka king (tarkÀmbarÀôka-pramiteÈvatÁteÈu ŒakÀntataÍ varÈeÈu Udayanaœcakre subodhÀm LakœaõÀvatÁm). Only “MuhÂrta-mÀrtÀõça”, a work on astronomy composed in 1571 CE, mentions that the birth of King ŒÀlivÀhana was the epoch of 78 CE (ŒÀlivÀhana-janmataÍ). Historians argued that ŒÀlivÀhana was a ŒÀtavÀhana who defeated a Œaka king but it is a wild, baseless speculation. The earliest use of the ŒÀlivÀhana era is found in the Pimpalner grant253 of the Western Chalukya SatyÀœrayadeva which is dated in 388 CE but the use of this era became popular only from the 7th century onwards. Some Indian scholars highlighted the issue of the existence of two Œaka eras from time to time but Western historians and their followers simply rejected the theory issue without any proper debate. Evidently, there were two eras, one that commenced in 583 BCE and the other in 78 CE: \u0002 The strongest epigraphic evidence i.e. the verifiable details of a total solar eclipse recorded in the Kurtaketi grant254 of Chalukya\n103 VikramÀditya and an annular solar eclipse recorded in the inscription255 found at Otur, Shimoga cannot be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). A total solar eclipse and an annular solar eclipse are the rarest of astronomical events and the verifiable details of these two inscriptions can only be explained in the Œaka era (583 BCE). \u0002 An inscription256 at Lakœmeœvar in DhÀrwÀr district mentions the dates of the death of Œrinandi Pançita and the death of BhÀskaranandi Pançita by the rite of Sallekhana. One date was expressed as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta” and the other as “Œaka-kÀla- yuktÀbda” which unambiguously indicate the existence of two different eras. \u0002 The RÀjapura plates of MadhurÀntakadeva257 referred to the ŒÀlivÀhana era as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-SaÚvat 987.....” clearly indicating the era (78 CE) that commenced from the end of the Œaka era (583 BCE). \u0002 It appears that the calendar of the Œaka era (583 BCE) existed till the 15th century CE. An inscription258 at the village of Bittaravalli, Belur taluka, KarõÀtaka is dated 2027 (1444 CE) [ŒakavarÈÀda 2027 neya °nanda SaÚvatsara BhÀdrapada œuddha padiva œukravÀradandu]. This date cannot be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Interestingly, historians edited it as 1027 because the year 2027 in the ŒÀlivÀhana era will be 2105 CE. The originator of Œaka era Originally, the Œakas or Scythians belonged to the Valley of the Helmund River in Afghanistan as the region was called ŒakasthÀna (SeistÀn). One branch of the Œakas probably ruled as allies or feudatories or officials of ancient Indian kings (probably, Yavana kings) of the North- Western region. Gradually, they learnt Sanskrit and adopted Indian traditions but Indian society viewed them as “MleccÍas” because they did not belong to any Rishi gotra. The Œakas were possibly appointed as Kœatrapas and MahÀkœatrapas during the reign of the so-called KuÈÀõa kings. The names of MahÀkœatrapa KharapallÀna and Kœatrapa Vanashpara find mention in some inscriptions259 found at SÀranÀth which are dated in the third regnal year of KaniÈka. Taking advantage of the weak Indian political conditions, the Œakas conquered TakœaœilÀ & MathurÀ in Northern India and MÀlava & KÀthiÀwÀr region in Western THE EPOCH OF THE ŒAKA ERA\n104 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA India. The Œaka rulers called themselves MahÀkœatraps. During the rule of the Œaka satraps, the Œaka era, a regnal reckoning of a Œaka king in commemoration of his coronation, was introduced in India in 583 BCE. There is a divergence of opinion about the exact originator of the Œaka era. The most popular view is that the KuÈÀõa king KaniÈka introduced this era and his Œaka kœatraps implemented it. It is well known that the Western kœatraps of Ujjain were the earliest users of the Œaka era. Two inscriptions of CaÈÇana found in Kutch district are dated in Œaka 11 (572 BCE) and Œaka 6 (577 BCE). Four Andhau inscriptions260 of CaÈÇana & RudradÀman are dated on the 2nd day of the dark fortnight of PhÀlguna month in Œaka 52 (19th February 531 BCE) [RÀjðo CaÈÇanasa Yaœomotika-putrasa rÀjðo RudradÀmasa JayadÀma-putrasa varÈe 50, 2 PhÀlguna-bahulasa dvitÁyÀm va 2]. There is no credible evidence to prove that CaÈÇana was a feudatory of the KuÈÀõa king KaniÈka. Prof. Ajay Mitra Shastri exposed the fallacy of this theory in detail in his article.261 According to him, there is absolutely no evidence to prove that Œaka Kœatraps like CaÈÇana, Bhumaka, NahapÀna etc. were in any way connected with, not to speak of their being subordinates to, the KuÈÀõas. Since the Œaka rulers were called Kœatraps, it has been speculated that some king must have ruled over then. Accordingly, some historians concocted the theory that the KuÈÀõa king KaniÈka was the originator of an era in 78 CE and the name Œaka was tagged to this era in a later period. It is quite absurd to believe that the KuÈÀõa king originated an era in the name of his subordinates i.e. Œakas. Moreover, KaniÈka cannot be the contemporary of CaÈÇana. According to RÀjataraôgiõÁ, KaniÈka flourished 150 year later from the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha. We will discuss the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha in",

Indian society never accepted them as “Kœatriya” because they did not belong to any Rishi gotra. Though, the Œaka Kœatraps became independent rulers, they were struggling to get social acceptance. It appears that CaÈÇana successfully persuaded some BrÀhmaõas of Ujjain to get bestow a Rishi gotra (Kardamaka Rishi gotra) for his dynasty and ensured that his coronation was carried out according to Indian traditions. Thus, CaÈÇana became the first Œaka king of Ujjain who was coronated by BrÀhmaõas who declared that he was a descendant of the Kardamaka Rishi gotra.\n105 CaÈÇana appears to be the likeliest originator of the Œaka era as he may have introduced it in commemoration of his coronation in 583 BCE. According to “KÀlakÀcÀryakathÀnaka” (a story of KÀlakÀcÀrya), a Jain source, Gardabhilla, the king of Ujjain abducted the sister of a Jain monk named KÀlakÀcÀrya. The hapless KÀlakÀcÀrya sought the aid of the Œakas (Sagakula). Numerous (around ninety-six) Œaka warriors accompanied KÀlakÀcÀrya and crossed the Indus to Kathiawar and then, to Ujjain. They defeated Gardabhilla in 723 BCE and ruled Ujjain for four years. VikramÀditya I drove them out of Ujjain and founded the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era in 719-718 BCE, an era that was earlier known as the KÃta era or MÀlava-gaõa era. VikramÀditya I and his four successors ruled Ujjain for 135 years. Around 583 BCE, the Œakas led by CaÈÇana conquered Kathiawar and Ujjain and re-established their kingdom in Western India. TS NÀrÀyaõa ŒÀstri, Prof. Gulshan Rai262 and Kota VenkatÀchalam263 opined that the Œaka king was the Persian Emperor Cyrus I and the Œaka Kœatrapas in India were his subordinates. Though some inscriptions of Darius I (522-486 BCE), the third king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, refer to some branches of the Œakas as his subordinates and to Punjab as a part of the Persian Empire. There is not even an iota of evidence, either epigraphic, numismatic or literary, to prove that the Œaka kœatraps of India were the subordinates of Persian kings. Moreover, the Œaka era commenced in 583 BCE as discussed in detail above, which clearly indicates that the Œakas started their rule in India at least 33 years before the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire in Persia. Interestingly, Cyrus was in intimate contact with one Indian king, who helped him with men and money;264 it was probably one of the Northern Œaka kœatrapas or CaÈÇana who was the Indian king who helped Cyrus. The Western Kœatrapas of Ujjain ruled over 337 years. The inscriptions of these rulers are dated from Œaka 6 (577 BCE) to Œaka 203 (380 BCE) and their coins from Œaka 100 (483 BCE) to Œaka 337 (246 BCE). The Junagarh inscription of MahÀkœatrapa RudradÀman I (the grandson of CaÈÇana) is dated in Œaka 72 (511 BCE) [SvÀmi CaÈÇanasya pautra ....... h putrasya Rajðo MahÀkœatrapasya ......

It appears that the Œaka kings of Ujjain patronised the influential astronomer-BrÀhmaõas of Ujjain so as to popularise the use of the Œaka era. The astronomers of Ujjain most certainly helped the Œaka kings to solve the problems in making the calendar of the Œaka era. Gradually, the calendar of the Œaka era became popular in Western and Southern India. Though Indians hated the Œakas, the use of the Œaka era found widespread use and continued for many centuries, even after the end of the Œaka rule until it was replaced by the Œaka-KÀlÀtÁta era i.e. the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Yavaneœvara and Sphujidhvaja (Œaka 56 or 191?) “YavanajÀtaka”, the famous text on the Yavana School of astrology was originally written by Yavaneœvara in his language. Later, the Yavana king Sphujidhvaja translated it into Sanskrit. This Sanskrit translation contained 4000 verses written in the IndravajrÀ meter. In the ancient Indian astronomical tradition, there were principally 18 recognised SiddhÀntas: SÂrya, PaitÀmaha, VyÀsa, VaœiÈÇha, Atri, PÀrÀœara, Kaœyapa, NÀrada, GÀrgya, MarÁchi, Manu, Aôgira, Lomaœa (Romaka), Pauliœa, Chyavana, Yavana, BhÃgu, and Œaunaka, of which only five, SÂrya, PaitÀmaha, VaœiÈÇha, Romaka and Pauliœa were extant during the time of VarÀhamihira. It is also evident that the Yavana siddhÀnta was one of the ancient siddhÀntas of Indian astronomy and it was admired at par with other siddhÀntas in ancient India. The last chapter (79th) of YavanajÀtaka is called “HorÀvidhi” in which the following verses were written: Iti svabhÀÈÀ-racanÀtiguptÀd ViÈõugrahÀrkendumayÀvatÀrÀt |",

The statement “Sphujidhvajo nÀma babhÂva rÀjÀ” indicates clearly that the author of the last chapter of YavanajÀtaka was not Sphujidhvaja but a later scholar. The earliest reference to the Œaka era is found in the last chapter of YavanajÀtaka. Gate Èaçagre’rdhaœate samÀnÀm KÀlakriyÀntattvamidam ŒakÀnÀm | Raviryuge SÂryadine prapede kramÀt tadabdÀdi yugÀdi bhÀnoÍ || 14|| One of the main features of YavanajÀtaka is the use of a solar Yuga or an astronomical cycle of 165 years. Indicating the date of the epoch of a solar Yuga of 165 years with reference to Œaka era, it is stated that when the 56th year of the Œakas is current (can also be interpreted as elapsed), on a Sunday, the beginning of that year is the beginning of the yuga of the sun. Considering the epoch of Œaka era in 583 BCE, the 56th year was 528-527 BCE. The date was probably 12th March 528 BCE when the conjunction of the Sun and Moon occurred at Meœa (Aries) 0o but the weekday was Wednesday. In my opinion, the weekday must be verified with reference to the siddhÀnta of “Ahargaõa” considered in Yavana siddhÀnta. It is not logical to verify the weekday with reference to other siddhÀntas.\n109 The last chapter of YavanajÀtaka deals with luni-solar astronomy on the basis of a solar yuga of 165 years and the synodic motion of the planets. It is clear that the Œakas and Yavanas shared a common heritage and that the Œakas followed the astrology of Yavana siddhÀnta. When the Western kœatrapas established their kingdom in Ujjain and introduced the Œaka era, a need was felt to present the Yavana siddhÀnta with reference to luni-solar astronomy because Indians followed the luni- solar calendar. Therefore, probably a later Yavana scholar wrote the 79th chapter of YavanajÀtaka, not part of the original text of Sphujidhvaja. It is evident that Yavaneœvara and Sphujidhvaja lived much earlier and prior to the introduction of Œaka era (583 BCE). The available text of YavanajÀtaka that includes the 79th chapter was written during the reign of the Western kœatrapas of Ujjain. David Pingree, a biased Indologist, translated the YavanajÀtaka into English in 1978. It is evident from his translation that he undertook this work with the intention of establishing that the YavanajÀtaka is originally a lost Greek text composed in Alexandria that was later translated into Sanskrit by Sphujidhvaja, an “Indianized Greek”. David Pingree was one of the racist and Eurocentric research scholars who could not digest the fact that India was the birthplace of astral sciences. He committed a number of forgeries to prove his spurious theory. First of all, Pingree conspired to date the YavanajÀtaka earlier than other Indian astronomical texts by inventing a fictitious “BhÂtasaôkhyÀ” so that he could propagate the theory of Greek influence on Indian astronomy. He fraudulently distorted the phrase “NÀrÀyaõÀrkendumayÀdidÃÈÇam” of verse 62 of",

Undoubtedly, David Pingree committed a fraud in his translation of the YavanajÀtaka. KS Shukla,1 Harry Falk and Bill M. THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n110 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Mak2 have rightly pointed out many “incorrect readings” (distortions) in the translation of David Pingree. Truly speaking, David Pingree has fraudulently fixed a particular date for Yavaneœvara and Sphujidhvaja so that he could establish the hypothesis of Greek influence on Indian astronomy. Pingree also propagated the fallacy that the ideas of the precession of equinoxes and the trepidation of equinoxes were introduced into India by the Greeks.3 It is a baseless claim. It is also an attempt at daylight robbery of the ancient Indian treasure-house of knowledge by a racist and Eurocentric scholar. Ancient Indians had the knowledge of precession and trepidation much before the birth of Hellenistic astronomy of the Greeks. Rigveda mentions the vernal equinox in PuÈya, Punarvasu and MÃgaœirÀ nakœatras. Aitareya BrÀhmaõa refers to the shifting of the vernal equinox from MÃgaœirÀ to Rohiõi. Atharva Veda (ayanam maghÀsu ca) and KauœÁtaki BrÀhmaõa also points out the beginning of New Year after the new moon in MaghÀ nakœatra at winter solstice. There exist tonnes of evidence [VedÀôga JyotiÈa (1400 BCE), PÀrÀœaratantra (between 1150 BCE and 1370 BCE), BÃhat SaÚhitÀ & PaðcasiddhÀntikÀ (between 156 BCE and 74 BCE)] to establish that ancient Indians were the first who discovered the precession and trepidation of equinoxes. David Pingree also speculated that Romaka meant Romans, that Pauliœa was a Greek and that the ancient Indian astronomer Maõittha mentioned by VarÀhamihira was not an Indian but a Greek named Manetho — all part of Pingree’s mischievously creative imagination. In his designs to prove that the Greeks were the pioneers of astronomy, David Pingree concluded fraudulently that the astronomy of °ryabhaÇa and later Indians was influenced by Hellenic astronomical ideas. He said that ‘much of what we know about Greek astronomy between Hipparchus and the 4th century can be found in Sanskrit texts’. Racially biased Pingree even claimed that ‘because of the Indian tendency to modify intellectual imports and also of the corrupt nature of the earliest surviving texts, it is often difficult to determine precisely the nature of Greek texts on which the Sanskrit texts are based’.

    "content": ". Chulla Niddeœa, a Buddhist text, gives a list of 16 mahÀjanapadas including one Yavana mahÀjanapada that existed before the birth of Buddha (2214 BCE). According to Majjhima NikÀya, one of the earliest Buddhist works, Buddha referred to Yavana deœa, KÀmboja deœa, etc. in conversation with °ssalÀyana. PÀõini (1800 BCE) also mentions about Yavanas and their script named YavanÀni. King Aœoka’s rock inscriptions mention the names of Yavana kings who were ruling in the north-western parts of India. RÀjataraôgiõÁ of Kalhaõa names five Yavana kingdoms i.e. AbhisÀra, Urga, SiÚhapura, Divya KaÇaka and Uttara JyotiÈa that are located West of Kashmir. Interestingly, some Yavana kings were feudatories of Kashmir kings. It is evident that the Yavanas were not Greeks but Indians and lived in the north-western parts of India. The names of Yavanas found in various Indian sources are also very much Indian. According to the NÀsik inscription4 at cave no. 17, a Yavana named IndrÀgnidatta, the son of Dhammadeva and his son Dharmarakœita excavated the cave and built a ChaityagÃha for Buddhist monks. Moreover, it seems that the Yavanas also followed catur-varõa system. Bhikœuko dhÀnyamuÈtÁnÀm yÀvano grÀmajo dvijaÍ | yo’pyabhÂdgrÀmadaivajðo vaidheyo loÈÇakÀbhidhaÍ|| 5 THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n112 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA This œloka of RÀjataraôgiõÁ tells us that a Yavana BrÀhmaõa named LoÈÇaka, who was born in the Yavana village and became a monk, was considered to be an astrologer of the village. In due course of time, the Yavanas were called “MleccÍas” as the later Yavanas neglected or disregarded the performance of the Vedic rituals but Yavana Brahmaõas were respected in Indian society because they were well educated in astronomy. VarÀhamihira quotes a œloka of Garga (500 BCE) that says that though the Yavanas are MleccÍas, they are well educated in astral sciences due to which they are respected like Rishis. MleccÍÀ hi yavanÀsteÈu samyak œÀstramidam sthitaÚ | ãiÈivatte’pi pÂjyante kim punardaivavid dvijaÍ ||6 It is evident from the above that the Yavanas were very much Indians who founded the Yavana school of astronomy and not the Greeks. The Indian history of Yavanas is much older than the birth of ancient Greek civilisation. The Yavanas probably belonged to one of the oldest branches of Rigveda. The Yavana astronomy/astrology has deeply influenced Babylonians and Egyptians. It is a well-known fact that the Hellenistic astronomy of the Greeks has borrowed heavily from Babylonian and Egyptian sources. There is no direct or indirect credible evidence available to prove that the Yavanas referred to in Indian sources were Greeks. Therefore, it is just the fantasy of a racist and Eurocentric mind- set that YavanajÀtaka is a lost work composed in Alexandria around 149- 150 CE by an unknown Greek author because it contains some algorithms of “ultimately Babylonian origin” and an “Indianised Greek” Sphujidhvaja translated it in 269-270 CE into Sanskrit. Yavaneœvara, the author of YavanajÀtaka had the knowledge of decimal place-value system, zero, the time-units of MuhÂrta, GhaÇikÀ, KalÀ, etc. and the solar yuga of 165 years. Indians also had the knowledge of a zodiac of 360 degrees which is subdivided into 12 signs since the Rigvedic period.7 Therefore, Yavaneœvara and Sphujidhvaja were Indians and not Greeks. PÀõini also mentions Yavanas and their script (YavanÀni). The recently discovered Rabatak inscription of KaniÈka in Afghanistan was probably written in the YavanÀni script and it is likely that the ancient Greeks borrowed the same script. The Rabatak\n113 inscription tells us that KaniÈka introduced Sanskrit and a phonetic script replacing the Yavana language and YavanÀni script. Yavaneœvara may have authored his “HorÀœÀstra” in his language and in the YavanÀni script and Sphujidhvaja translated it into Sanskrit before the commencement of the Œaka era in 583 BCE and the 79th chapter of YavanajÀtaka was written by a later Yavana scholar during the reign of the Western kœatrapas around the 5th or 4th century BCE much before the birth of the Hellenistic astronomy of the Greeks. Since ParÀœara (1370- 1150 BCE) and Garga (500 BCE) mention about Yavana siddhÀnta, Yavaneœvara undoubtedly lived prior to 1400 BCE. Most probably, Yavaneœvara flourished around 2200-2000 BCE before the introduction of Sanskrit by KaniÈka and the Yavana king Sphujidhvaja around 1500 BCE to 1000 BCE. Sometimes, Sphujidhvaja was also referred to as Yavaneœvara because he was also the king of the Yavanas. Sarvanandi and SiÚhasÂri (Œaka 380) “LokavibhÀga”, the Jain work on cosmologywas originally written in Prakrit by Sarvanandi and SiÚhasÂri translated it into Sanskrit in Œaka 380 (204-203 BCE). Vaiœve sthite ravisute vÃÈabhe ca jÁve, rÀjottareÈu sitapakœamupetya candre | GrÀme ca PÀÇalika-nÀmni ca pÀõa-rÀÈÇre œÀstram purÀ likhitavÀn Muni-SarvanandÁ || 8 Samvatsare tu dvÀviÚœe kÀðchÁœa-SiÚhavarmaõaÍ | AœÁtyagre œakÀbdÀnÀm siddhametat œatatraye || 9 SiÚhasÂri tells us that Jaina Muni Sarvanandi authored LokavibhÀga in the village named “PÀtalika” in PÀõarÀÈÇra (the country of BÀõas or PÀnçyas). The date of Sarvanandi can be fixed around 6th century BCE. SiÚhasÂri translated LokavibhÀga into Sanskrit during the 22nd regnal year of the Pallava king SiÚhavarman and in Œaka 380 (204-203 BCE). SiÚhavarman, the descendent of ViÈõugopavarman, ruled around Œaka 358-403 (225-180 BCE). THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n114 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA GuõÀçhya GuõÀçhya authored the “Vadda-KathÀ” or BÃhat-KathÀ in PaiœÀchi, a literary dialect of Prakrit. Sanskrit poets Subandhu, Dançin and BÀõabhaÇÇa mention GuõÀçhya. He may have flourished during the reign of ŒÀtavÀhanas in PratiÈÇhÀna (modern Paithan), in any case not later the 5th century BCE. The Western Ganga king DurvinÁta, who ruled around Œaka 390-445 (193-138 BCE), translated BÃhat-KathÀ into Sanskrit. BhÀravi BhÀravi, the legendary Sanskrit poet, was the author of “KirÀtÀrjunÁyam”. According to “AvantisundarikathÀ” of Dançin, BhÀravi was a contemporary of Chalukya Vishnuvardhana (Western Chalukya king JayasiÚha I or Pulakeœin I), Ganga DurvinÁta and Pallava SiÚhavishnu. The Ganga king DurvinÁta wrote a commentary on the 15th Sarga (canto) of KirÀtÀrjunÁyam in his 20th regnal year (173 BCE). Therefore, BhÀravi must have lived between 220 BCE to 140 BCE. The Sanskrit poet Dançin relates an interesting story about BhÀravi in his work “AvantisundarikathÀ”. Dançin also tells us that his great-grandfather was a friend of BhÀravi and was introduced by him to king Vishnuvardhana which indicates that Dançin must have flourished around the 1st century BCE. VarÀhamihira (Œaka 427-509) VarÀhamihira, the son of °dityadÀsa and the most celebrated astronomer of Avanti (Ujjain), was born in KÀmpilyaka or KÀpitthaka. He authored three treatises i.e. PaðcasiddhÀntikÀ, BÃhajjÀtakam and BÃhat SaÚhitÀ. VarÀhamihira used the expressions “Œakendra-kÀla”, “Œaka-bhÂpa- kÀla”, “Œaka-kÀla”, etc. which unambiguously refer to the Œaka era (583 BCE) and not to the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Interestingly, VarÀhamihira quoted a œloka of VÃddha Garga which indicates the epoch of the Œaka era. °san-maghÀsu munayaÍ œÀsati pÃthvÁm YudhiÈÇhire nÃpatau | Øaç-dvika-Paðca-dvi-yutaÍ Œaka-kÀlastasya rÀjðaœca || 10 “The Great Bear (munayaÍ = SaptarÈis) was in the constellation of MaghÀ, when king YudhiÈÇhira ruled the Earth; the interval between\n115 the YudhiÈÇhira kÀla and the Œaka kÀla was 2526 years.” Since the Œaka kÀla commenced in 583 BCE, if we add 2526 to that figure, then 3109 BCE was the year in which the rule of YudhiÈÇhira probably ended. It follows that YudhiÈÇhira must have either died in 3109 BCE or handed over the reins to his grandson ParÁkœit. VÃddha Garga and VarÀhamihira calculated 2526 years from 3109 BCE to fix the epoch of Œaka era in 583 BCE. In case the Œaka era had commenced in 78 CE, then the YudhiÈÇhira kÀla ought to end in 2448 BCE which cannot be reconciled with the date of YudhiÈÇhira given in all ancient literary sources. Moreover, the Great Bear was in the constellation of MaghÀ during 3176-3077 BCE whereas it was in the constellation of KÃttikÀ during 2476-2377 BCE. VarÀhamihira also gave Œaka 427 elapsed (156-155 BCE) as KaraõÀbda for calculation of Ahargaõa (counting of days). SaptÀœvivedasaôkhyam Œaka-kÀlamapÀsya Chaitra-œuklÀdau | ArdhÀstamite bhÀnau Yavanapure SaumyadivasÀdye || 11 “Subtract 427 from Œaka kÀla i.e. 583 BCE, when the sun is half setting at Yavanapura at the beginning of Chaitra œuklapakœa and it is the beginning of Wednesday.” Considering the epoch of Œaka era in 583 BCE, the year of Œaka 427 elapsed was 156-155 BCE and the date intended by VarÀhamihira was 9th March 156 BCE and the weekday was Wednesday. °marÀja Daivajða, who wrote a commentary on “KhandakhÀdyaka” of Brahmagupta, mentions that VarÀhamihira died in Œaka 509 (74 BCE) [NavÀdhika-paðca-œata-sankhya-œake VarÀhamihirÀcÀryo divam gataÍ] when the trepidation (the oscillation in the precession of equinoxes) was nil. °marÀja also state that there was no trepidation in Œaka 511 (72 BCE). He assumes that the limit of trepidation is 24o from fixed Aries 0o. Considering the rate of trepidation 0.1o per year or 1 degree in 60 years, it was fixed at Aries 0o in the beginning of Kaliyuga i.e. 3102 BCE. Therefore, the trepidation was nil during 3102-3042 BCE, 1602-1542 BCE and 102-42 BCE. Precisely, °marÀja tells us that the trepidation was nil in Œaka 509 (74 BCE) and Œaka 511(72 BCE) considering the epoch of the Œaka era in 583 BCE. Nil trepidation cannot be explained in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. Therefore, °marÀja refers to the Œaka era (583 BCE) and THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n116 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). We can thus fix the lifetime of VarÀhamihira between Œaka 427 and Œaka 509 (156-74 BCE). Prof Gulsan Rai12 reads that there was an interval of 427 years between the epoch of Cyrus and the coronation of Mithradates II. Therefore, VarÀhamihira adopted the Œaka year 427 for the purpose of calculations. V Thituvenkatacharya13 presented an astronomical proof assuming zero ayanÀÚœa in Œaka 427 i.e. 124 BCE (considering the epoch of Œaka era in 551 BCE) but VarÀhamihira did not mention any thing about zero ayanÀÚœa. Interestingly, VarÀhamihira mentions the points in the ecliptic, at which, winter and summer solstices occurred at the time of VedÀôga JyotiÈa (1400 BCE) and his time (around 100 BCE). Based on the details given by VarÀhamihira, we can determine the exact number of degrees by which the solstices in the ecliptic have receded. By dividing the difference by the rate of precession of equinoxes, we can calculate the exact number of years which intervened between the time of VarÀhamihira and VedÀôga JyotiÈa. VarÀhamihira states: °œleÈÀrdhÀd-dakœiõamuttaramayanam raverdhaniÈÇhÀdyÀm | NÂnam kadÀcidÀsÁd yenoktam purvaœÀstreÈu || SÀmpratamayanam savituÍ karkaÇakÀdyÀm mÃgÀditaœcÀnyÀt | Uktabhavo vikÃtiÍ pratyakœa-parÁkœaõair-vyaktiÍ || 14 “At the time the Sun’s southward course commenced on his reaching the middle of °œleÈÀ, and its northward course on his reaching the beginning of DhaniÈÇhÀ. This must have been the case as we find it so recorded in ancient ŒÀstras (VedÀôga JyotiÈa). But at present the one course of the Sun commences at the beginning of KarkaÇaka (Cancer), and the other at the beginning of Makara (Capricorn).” °œleÈÀrdhÀdÀsÁdyadÀ nivÃttiÍ kiloÈõakiraõasya | Yuktamayanam tadÀsÁt sÀmpratamayanam punarvasutaÍ || 15 “Once the Sun changed his course from the mid-point of °œleÈÀ; but at present, the Ayana begins from Punarvasu.” Based on the positions of solstices in the ecliptic given by VarÀhamihira as detailed above, it can be derived that VarÀhamihira\n117 must have authored BÃhat SaÚhitÀ and PaðcasiddhÀntikÀ in the beginning of the 1st century BCE. Therefore, the “Œaka-kÀla” referred by VarÀhamihira was Œaka era (583 BCE) and not ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). One more argument is given that VarÀhamihira mentions °ryabhaÇa (LankÀrdharÀtra-samaye dina-pravÃttim jagÀda cÀryabhaÇaÍ)16 who was born in 5th century CE. Therefore, VarÀhamihira’s date must be fixed in ŒÀlivÀhana era from 505 CE to 587 CE. According to TS NÀrÀyaõa ŒÀstry and Kota VenkatÀchalam, the genuine old manuscripts of °ryabhaÇÁyam contained the following version of the verse. “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir-yadÀ vyatÁtÀÍ trayaœca yugapÀdÀÍ | TryÀdhika viÚœatir-abdÀÍ tadeha mama janmano’tÁtÀÍ || ”17 °ryabhaÇa tells us that he was born when 360 (60 ××××× 6) years and three yugas (KÃta, Treta & DvÀpara) elapsed. Since Kaliyuga started in 3102 BCE, °ryabhaÇa’s birth year was 2742-2741 BCE and he wrote °ryabhaÇÁyam when 23 years elapsed from his birth year. Thus, °ryabhaÇa wrote °ryabhaÇÁyam in 2719-2718 BCE and a later scholar probably edited this verse of °ryabhaÇa by replacing “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir” with “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm ÈaÈÇir” to arrive at the birth year of °ryabhaÇa as the Kali year 3600 (60 ××××× 60). Western scholars simply assumed “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm ÈaÈÇir” as original text because it suited their distorted chronology and concluded that 499 CE is the birth year of °ryabhaÇa and he wrote his work in 522 CE. When Western scholars came to know that VarÀhamihira mentions °ryabhaÇa, they subtracted 23 years from 3600 and propagated that actually °ryabhaÇa was born in 476 CE and wrote his work in 499 CE because VarÀhamihira mentions the Œaka year 427 in his work. It is a blatant distortion because °ryabhaÇa explicitly states that when 360 or 3600 years elapsed in Kaliyuga and then 23 years also elapsed from his birth year which unambiguously indicates that he was born either in Kali year 360 or 3600. Moreover, “ÈaçbhiÍ” (tritiyÀ vibhakti) is correct expression according to Sanskrit grammar whereas “ÈaÈÇiÍ” (prathamÀ vibhakti) is an incorrect expression. An astronomical manual called “DÃkkaraõa” composed in Malayalam in 1607-08 CE records that: THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n118 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “Before Kaliyuga, the eclipses and other observed phenomena did not tally with the manuals of siddhÀntas. Then, °ryabhaÇa was born in Kali year “Jðanatuôga” (3600?) [“Jðatuôga” (360)?] and wrote his work in “Girituôga” (3623?) [“Girduôga” (383)?].”18 We have to verify the actual text of °ryabhaÇÁyam from the oldest original manuscripts and also the original text of DÃkkaraõa and various commentaries on °ryabhaÇÁyam to ascertain the correctness of the phrase “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir” or “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm ÈaÈÇir”. But it is evident that °ryabhaÇa was completely ignorant of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 BCE). He refers only to the Kali era thus establishing that he flourished much before the commencement of the Œaka era (583 BCE). VarÀhamihira uses the verb “JagÀda” in the remote past tense (parokœa bhÂtakÀla) with reference to °ryabhaÇa. Thus, °ryabhaÇa cannot be a contemporary of VarÀhamihira. According to Sanskrit grammar, the remote past tense (parokœa bhÂtakÀla) cannot be used for living or contemporary persons and is to be used only for events occurred earlier than the lifetime of the user. Therefore, °ryabhaÇa flourished before the lifetime of VarÀhamihira (156-74 BCE). According to °ryabhaÇa, the rate of precession of equinox was 46.30 seconds of arc per sidereal year whereas VarÀhamihira gave the rate of precession around 50.00 seconds of arc per sidereal year. Actually, the rate of precession is not constant. The average rate of precession (minimum precession) is about 1 degree every 72 years when the Sun is at apoapsis and the average rate of precession (maximum precession) is 1 degree every 60 years when the Sun is at periapsis. The earth will average about 1 degree of precession every 66.6 years over the 24000 year cycle. The rate of precession was around 49.83 in the 1st century BCE and VarÀhamihira’s estimate of 50.00 seconds of arc was extremely accurate. The rate of precession was 50.25 in 1900 CE, 50.29 in 2000 CE and it will be 50.33 in 2100 CE. Interestingly, the rate of precession was 49.39 in 2000 BCE. It was approximately 49.00 in 3102 BCE. °ryabhaÇa was probably born in 360 Kali year elapsed and he estimated the rate of precession approximately as 46.30 seconds. Therefore, “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir” may be the original statement of °ryabhaÇa not “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm\n119 ÈaÈÇir” as claimed by some scholars. It may also be noted that there is no reference to the Œaka era or the ŒÀlivÀhana era in °ryabhaÇÁyam. Internal evidence of °ryabhaÇÁyam also suggests that °ryabhaÇa may belong to a much older period than 499 CE. °ryabhaÇa mentions that “In a MahÀyuga, the Sun revolves 4,320,000 times, the Moon 57,753,336 times and the Earth 1,582,237,500 eastward”. Thus, °ryabhaÇa calculated an extremely accurate ratio 1582237500/57753336 = 27.3964693572 for the number of axial rotations of earth per lunar orbit. According to modern estimates, the value was 27.39646514 in 500 CE and 27.39646389 in 2000 CE. Interestingly, the value given by °ryabhaÇa was accurate up to ten decimal places around 1604 BCE. Therefore, °ryabhaÇa must have been born in the 360th year (2742 BCE) from the epoch of Kaliyuga and not in the 3600th year (499 CE). As established above, VarÀhamihira flourished between 156 BCE to 74 BCE and mentions °ryabhaÇa. °ryabhaÇa was completely ignorant of the Œaka era. Therefore, the date of °ryabhaÇa must be fixed as clearly being prior to VarÀhamihira and before the commencement of the Œaka era in 583 BCE. In fact, Sudhakar Dwivedi (1855-1910) has distorted the phrase “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir” by replacing it with “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm ÈaÈÇir” under the influence of Western scholars. Therefore, “ØaÈÇyabdÀnÀm Èaçbhir” is the correct version of the œloka of °ryabhaÇÁyam and °ryabhaÇa must have been born in Kali year 360 i.e. 2742-2741 BCE and authored °ryabhaÇÁyam around 2719-2718 BCE. KÀlidÀsa (Œaka 445) The most celebrated Sanskrit poet, KÀlidÀsa authored numerous works like “AbhijðÀnaœÀkuntalam”, “MÀlavikÀgnimitram”, “VikramorvaœÁyam”, “RaghuvaÚœam”, “KumÀrasaÚbhavam”, “MeghadÂtam”, “ãitusaÚhÀram”, etc. KÀlidÀsa also authored an astronomical work named “JyotirvidÀbharaõam” in Kali year 3068 (34 BCE). VarÈaiÍ sindhuradarœanÀmbaraguõair-yÀte kalau saÚmite, MÀse MÀdhava-saÚjðake ca vihito grantha-kriyopakramaÍ | NÀnÀ-kÀla-vidhÀna-œÀstra-gadita-jðÀnam vilokyÀdarÀd, ²rje grantha-samÀptiratra vihitÀ jyotirvidÀm prÁtaye || 19 THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n120 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA KÀlidÀsa states that “I began to write this work (JyotirvidÀbharaõa) in the Kali year 3068 and in the month of MÀdhava (VaiœÀkha). Having consulted treatises on several systems of astronomy, I have completed the work in the month of ²rja (KÀrttika)”. Thus, KÀlidÀsa started writing JyotividÀbharaõa on 10th April 34 BCE and completed it by 1st November 34 BCE. KÀlidÀsa also gave Œaka 445 elapsed (138-137 BCE) as KaraõÀbda in his work (ŒarÀmbodhiyugo nÁto hÃto mÀnam........ ayanam Œakasya). We can thus fix the lifetime of KÀlidÀsa between 105 BCE to 25 BCE. KÀlidÀsa claims that he was one of the navaratnas of King VikramÀditya and a junior contemporary of VarÀhamihira. Dhanvantari-KœapaõakÀmarsiÚha-Œaôku- VetÀlabhaÇÇa-GhaÇakarpara-KÀlidÀsÀÍ | KhyÀto VarÀhamihiro nÃpateÍ sabhÀyÀm ratnÀni vai Vararuchir nava Vikramasya || 20 Dhanvantari, Kœapaõaka, AmarasiÚha, Œaôku, VetÀlabhaÇÇa, Ghatakarpara, KÀlidÀsa, VarÀhamihira and Vararuchi were the nine gems in the court of King VikramÀditya. KÀlidÀsa also dedicated his work to VikramÀditya, the king of Ujjain. Historians wrongly identified Chandragupta II as VikramÀditya of KÀlidÀsa. Western historians wrongly conjectured that VikramÀditya was a mythical ruler and deliberately propounded the myth that KÀlidÀsa was the court poet of Chandragupta II. Unfortunately, eminent Indian historians also blindly followed them though every piece of literary evidence was to the contrary. Moreover, KÀlidÀsa referred to VarÀhamihira as his senior contemporary but eminent historians ridiculously believe that KÀlidÀsa flourished during the reign of Chandragupta II (380-415 CE) and VarÀhamihira lived around 505-587 CE. The VikramÀditya mentioned by KÀlidÀsa was the king of Ujjain. VarÀhamihira was also in the court of the king of Ujjain. According to BhaviÈya PurÀõa,21 VikramÀditya was born in the Kali year 3000 (102- 101 BCE) to destroy the Œakas and became the king of AmbÀvati (AmarÀvati in Vidarbha) around 82 BCE. RÀjataraôgiõÁ also mentions about the VikramÀditya, who was the king of Ujjain in the 1st century BCE. According to the PurÀõas, the PramÀra or ParamÀra dynasty (one\n121 of the four Agni vaÚœas i.e. PramÀra, PratÁhÀra, Chaulukya and ChÀhamÀna) was ruling in the 4th century BCE. It was VikramÀditya who restored the glory of the PramÀra dynasty in 1st century BCE by defeating the Œakas. It appears that VikramÀditya killed a Œaka king around 57 BCE which became the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. KÀlidÀsa tells us in his work “JyotirvidÀbharaõa” about the victory of VikramÀditya against a Œaka king. “Yo RummakeœÀdhipatim Œakeœvaram jitvÀ grahito’jjayinÁm mahÀhave | °nÁya saÚbhrÀmya mumoca tam tvaho Œri-VikramÀrka-samasahyavikramaÍ || ”22 “Vikrama of irresistible valour defeated the Œaka king of the province “Rummakeœa” in North-west India, brought him to Ujjain, took him round the city as a captive and released him.” Alberuni23 also records that VikramÀditya killed a Œaka king in the region of Karur between Multan and the castle of Loni. HariswÀmi, who wrote a commentary named “ŒrutivivÃti” on Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa, mentions about the king of Avanti, VikramÀditya (Œrimato’vantinÀthasya VikramÀrkasya bhÂpateÍ). It is evident that VikramÀditya was not a mythical ruler but the real ruler of Ujjain who flourished during the 1st century BCE. KÀlidÀsa also wrote a drama named “Kuntaleœvaradautyam” which is now lost. Kœemendra, the author of “AucityavicÀracarcÀ”, quotes a verse from KÀlidÀsa’s Kuntaleœvaradautya as an illustration of Adhikaraõaucitya (propriety of place): KÀlidÀsa was sent as the ambassador of king VikramÀditya to the court of the king of Kuntala i.e. the early Chalukya king Pulakeœin II (52-22 BCE) where he did not get a seat worthy of an ambassador of a great king like VikramÀditya, and therefore, sat on the ground. When asked why he did so, KÀlidÀsa recited the following verse: iha nivasati meruÍ œekharaÍ kœmÀdharÀõÀm, iha vinihitabhÀraÍ sÀgaraÍ sapta cÀnye | idamahipatibhoga-sthambhavibhrÀjamÀnÀm, dharaõitalamihaiva sthÀnamasmadvidhÀnÀm || THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n122 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “This is the only proper seat for us, which is rendered immovable by the numerous pillar-like hoods of the ŒeÈa NÀga (lord of serpents); since it is here that Meru, the lord of mountains and also the seven seas are seated. And I am in no way inferior to them”.24 ŒriôgÀraprakÀœa of king Bhoja also quotes from KÀlidÀsa’s Kuntaleœvaradautyam from which it is quite clear that KÀlidÀsa’s visit to the court of Chalukya king Pulakeœin II was eventful. RavikÁrti, the author of the Aihole inscription25 of Œaka 556 (27 BCE), proudly mentions the names of KÀlidÀsa and BhÀravi. It can be concluded from the above that KÀlidÀsa was the court poet of the Ujjain king VikramÀditya and flourished in the 1st century BCE. According to the PurÀõas, VikramÀditya’s son Devabhakta succeeded him and it appear that the Œakas again occupied Ujjain during the reign of Devabhakta. ŒÀlivÀhana probably won the war against the Œakas decisively and killed their last king in 78 CE. Thus, Indian astronomers introduced the epoch of the Vikrama era in 57 BCE to commemorate the victory of VikramÀditya against the Œakas and the epoch of ŒÀlivÀhana era in 78 CE in commemoration of the death of the last Œaka king and the victory of ŒÀlivÀhana. The year 78 CE was initially celebrated as the end of the Œaka era that commenced in 583 BCE to commemorate the coronation of Œaka king. Therefore, the ŒÀlivÀhana era was initially referred to as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtita-saÚvatsara” (the years from the end of the era of Œaka kings) till the 9th century CE. In due course of time, Indians forgot the difference between the Œaka era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era and started using same expressions “ŒakavarÈam .... neya”, “ŒÀke”, “Œaka-vatsare”, etc. for the ŒÀlivÀhana era that created confusion. Therefore, Indian astronomers introduced the prefixing of the name of ŒÀlivÀhana in the 9th century CE to distinguish it from the Œaka era. Interestingly, VÀkÀÇaka king Pravarasena II (210-180 BCE), the son of the daughter of Chandragupta II, wrote a KÀvya “Setubandha” in Prakrit which had been revised or re-composed in Sanskrit by KÀlidÀsa by the order of king VikramÀditya as stated by the commentator RÀmadÀsa. Chandragupta II, the maternal grandfather of Pravarasena\n123 II, died at least a few years before the Setubandha could have been written. KÀlidÀsa, who refers to himself as “nÃpasakhÀ” which meant the same age group friend of VikramÀditya, may have also died by then. Therefore, Chandragupta II was not the VikramÀditya who patronised KÀlidÀsa. AœvaghoÈa, the author of Buddhacarita, wrote numerous passages similar to those occurring in the works of KÀlidÀsa. It is evident that AœvaghoÈa was influenced by KÀlidÀsa’s works. AœvaghoÈa lived during the 1st century CE. Moreover, in the 6th act of AbhijðÀnaœÀkuntalam, KÀlidÀsa states that the merchant Dhanamitra died heirless because it was the period when the widow of a deceased person could not inherit his property. Such laws existed only up to the beginning of the 1st century CE in India. Therefore, KÀlidÀsa’s lifetime can undoubtedly be fixed around 105-25 BCE. Brahmagupta (Œaka 550) Brahmagupta was the author of the famous astronomical work “Brahma SphuÇasiddhÀnta”. He records that he wrote the Brahma SphuÇasiddhÀnta in Œaka 550 elapsed (33-32 BCE) when he was 30 years old during the reign of the king of the ChÀpa dynasty Œri VyÀgrhamukha. Therefore, he was born in Œaka 520 elapsed (63-62 BCE). Œri-CÀpa-vaÚœa-tilake Œri-VyÀghramukhe nÃpe Œaka-nÃpÀõÀm, PaðcÀœat-saÚyuktair varÈa-œataiÍ paðcabhiratÁtaiÍ | BrÀhmaÍ SphuÇasiddhÀntaÍ sajjana-ganitajða-golavit-prÁtyai, TriÚœadvarÈeõa kÃto Jishõu-suta-Brahmaguptena || 26 Brahmagupta clearly refers to the Œaka era (583 BCE) by stating “Œaka-nÃpÀõÀm”. Brahmagupta also wrote “KhançakhÀdyaka” in the 37th year from the date of Brahma SphutasiddhÀnta (Œaka 550) i.e. Œaka 587 (3- 4 CE). We can thus fix the lifetime of Brahmagupta between Œaka 520 to Œaka 600 (63 BCE-17 CE). Interestingly, Western scholars edited the phrase “Œaka-nÃpÀõÀm” as “Œaka-nÃpÀlÀt”. Some of the manuscripts erroneously included the verses quoted by the commentators. For instance, the 26th verse of",

It seems that some statements of THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n124 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the commentators containing the phrase “ŒakÀnte”, Œaka-nÃpÀnte”, etc. were mixed up with the original text of Brahma SphuÇasiddhÀnta due to which, it was assumed that Brahmagupta had knowledge of the epoch of 78 CE. We have to refer to the unedited version and the original manuscripts to ascertain the actual text of Brahma SphuÇasiddhÀnta. While studying the intercalated months referred to in the Nepali inscriptions, ShankarÀman RÀjavaÚshi, a research scholar of the Archaeological department has attempted to show that Brahma SiddhÀnta works successfully provided the epoch year is pushed back by 22 years prior to 78 CE – 22 = 56 CE.28 He has produced a table where the years showing intercalated months completely agree with the epigraphic data. Historians ignored his research assuming that Brahma SphuÇasiddhÀnta was written in ŒÀlivÀhana 550 (628 CE). Actually, Brahmagupta wrote his work in Œaka 550 (33-32 BCE) and not in ŒÀlivÀhana 550 (628 CE). LallÀchÀrya LallÀchÀrya, the author of “ŒiÈyadhÁvÃddhidatantra”, also refers to the Œaka era as “ŒakakœitÁœÀbda”, “ŒÀke”, etc. He was the son of Trivikrama BhaÇÇa and the grandson of SÀmba. He also clearly tells us that the ŒakakœitÁœÀbda i.e. Œaka era ended in 78 CE. This means the epoch of the Œaka era is earlier than 78 CE. “NandÀdricandrÀnala-saÚyuto bhavet, ŒakakœitÁœÀbda-gaõo gataÍ kaleÍ | DivÀkaraghno gatamÀsa-saÚyutaÍ, KhavahninighnasthitibhiÍ samanvitaÍ || 29 Elaborating the above verse, MallikÀrjuna SÂri, a commentator on “ŒiÈyadhÁvÃddhidatantra”, states: “ŒakanÃpÀbdagaõah sahasratrayeõaikonÀœÁtyadhika-œatena (3179) sahitaÍ KaligatÀbda-gaõo bhavati”. It is evident that Lalla and MallikÀrjuna SÂri explicitly state here that “3179 Kali years are elapsed including the years of Œaka era”. Thus, Œaka era and ŒÀlivÀhana era are not the same but two different eras.\n125 Explaining a formula for certain calculations, Lalla states: “Subtract 420 from the Œaka year elapsed, multiply the remainder severally by 25, 114, 96, 47 and 153. Divide each product by 250” (ŒÀke nakhÀbdhi-rahite).30 It indicates that Lalla proposed certain necessary corrections in calculating the positions of planets with the constants given by °ryabhaÇa and the year in which these corrections to be effective was 250 years after Œaka year 420 (164-163 BCE) elapsed. Therefore, it can be concluded that Lalla authored his work in Œaka 671(87-88 CE). It seems that the two verses, in which the above formula appears, may not be the part of “ŒiÈyadhÁvÃddhidatantra” because the commentary of Bhaskaracharya and Mallikarjuna SÂri is not available on these verses but SÂryadeva YajvÀ (12th century CE), Parameœvara (14th century CE) and Yallayya (15th century CE) quoted these verses as composed by Lalla. However, we can fix the date of Lalla in the 1st or 2nd century CE because Bhaskaracharya (452-532 CE) wrote a commentary on his work. Udyotana SÂri (Œaka 700) The Jain scholar Udyotana SÂri authored his work “KuvalayamÀlÀ” on astrology in Œaka 700 (116-117 CE) during the reign of the PratÁhÀra king VatsarÀja. An inscription of king VatsarÀja31 tells us that he was ruling in Œaka 717 elapsed (134-135 CE) [muni-œaœi-naga (717) saÚsthe yÀnti kÀle œakÀnÀm]. It appears that PratÁhÀra VatsarÀja ruled between 110 CE to 140 CE. The date given in KuvalayamÀlÀ is Chaitra kÃÈõa caturdaœi of Œaka 700. Therefore, Udyotana SÂri authored KuvalayamÀlÀ on 30th March 116 CE. Interestingly, KuvalayamÀlÀ is also an exhaustive work on social and cultural history of the 2nd century and gives the description of 34 Janapadas and 20 states of India. Jinasena (Œaka 705) A Jain scholar Jinasena flourished during the reign of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Govinda, Indra and AmoghavarÈa. Lokasena’s praœasti in UttarapurÀõa tells us that Jinasena, the guru of Guõabhadra, was a contemporary of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AmoghavarÈa. In the concluding praœasti of “HarivaÚœa” a Jaina PurÀõa, Jinasena gives the date of completion in Œaka year 705 elapsed (122-123 CE). THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n126 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “ŒÀkeÈvabdaœateÈu SaptaÈu diœam paðcottareÈÂttarÀm, PÀtÁndrÀyudhanÀmni KÃÈõanÃpaje Œrivallabhe DakœiõÀm |”32 Vateœvara (Œaka 802) Vateœvara was the author of “Vateœvara SiddhÀnta” where he states that he was the son of MahÀdatta BhaÇÇa, a native of °nandapura in Punjab and was born in Œaka 802. He refers the era as “Œakendra-kÀla” which clearly indicates Œaka era (583 BCE) and not ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Thus, Vateœvara was born in 218-219 CE (Œaka 802). He wrote “Vateœvara SiddhÀnta” when he was 24 years old i.e. in 243 CE. He also authored “KaraõasÀra” in Œaka 821 (238 CE). Guõabhadra & Lokasena (Œaka 820) Guõabhadra was the author of UttarapurÀõa. Lokasena, the disciple of Guõabhadra, wrote a “praœasti” in Œaka 820 (237 CE) at the end of UttarapurÀõa during the reign of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AkÀlavarÈa. He clearly mentions the Œaka era as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀbhyantara” to distinguish it from “Œaka-nÃpa-KÀlÀtÁta-samvatsara”. “AkÀlavarÈa-bhÂpÀle pÀlayatyakhilÀnilam........... Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀbyantara- viÚœatyadhikÀÈta-œata-mitÀbdÀnte Maôgala-mahÀrtha-kÀriõi Piôgala nÀmani samasta-jana-sukhade.”33 MuðjÀla (Œaka 584 or 854) MuðjÀla wrote his work “LaghumÀnasa” in Œaka 584 (1 CE). According to Kedarnath Joshi, MuðjÀla gave Œaka 434 (150-149 CE) as the year of Ayanacalana or the year of zero ayanÀÚœa.34 Therefore, it seems that MuðjÀla was a contemporary of Brahmagupta. According to some other sources, MuðjÀla has given the trepidation of equinoxes as 6:50o for Œaka 854. Thus, MuðjÀla authored his works around Œaka 854 (271-272 CE). We have to study further to ascertain the exact date of MuðjÀla. BhaÇÇotpala (Œaka 888) BhaÇÇotpala wrote commentaries on the works of VarÀhamihira and Brahmagupta. He wrote a commentary named “CintÀmaõi” on\n127 VarÀhamihira’s BÃhat SaÚhitÀ. In the commentary named “VivÃti” on VarÀhamihira’s BrihajjÀtaka, BhaÇÇotpala stated that he completed the commentary on Chaitra œukla paðcamÁ of Œaka 888 (304-305 CE) i.e. 27th February 304 CE. ChaitramÀsasya paðcamyÀm sitÀyÀm guruvÀsare | VasvaÈÇÀÈÇamite ŒÀke kÃteyam VivÃtir-mayÀ || Interestingly, BhaÇÇotpala mentions that the ayanÀÚœa was 7 days during his time or to be more accurate 61/2 degrees (sÀrdha-ÈatkÀÚœaÍ) according to one reading. V TiruvenkatÀcharya proved that the interval between the epoch of PaðcasiddhÀntikÀ and the completion of the commentary on BrihajjÀtaka is 888-427 = 461 years. Therefore, the value of the annual rate of precession of equinoxes is 61/2 degrees/461 = 390 ××××× 60/461 seconds = 50.8 seconds which may be considered as a fairly accurate value. Œripati (Œaka 961) Œripati wrote his works “SiddhÀntaœekhara” and “DhÁkoÇikaraõa” in Œaka year 961 elapsed (378-379 CE) [CandrÀôganando 961 naœako’rkanighnaœchaitrÀdimasair.....].35 Œripati was probably 40 years old when he authored “SiddhÀntaœekhara” and must have been born in Œaka 921 (338-339 CE). He also authored “DhruvamÀnasa” in Œaka 978 (395- 396 CE) and many other works like JÀtaka-paddhati and JyotiÈa-ratnamÀlÀ, etc. Bhaskaracharya (Œaka 1036) BhÀskara, one of the most celebrated Indian astronomers, records that he was born in the 1036th year of the era of the Œaka king (Œaka-nÃpa samaye). Rasa-guõa-pÂrõa-mahÁ (1036) sama Œaka-nÃpa-samaye’bhavanmamotpattiÍ | Rasa-guõa (36) varÈeõa mayÀ SiddhÀnta-ŒiromaõÁ racitaÍ || 36 Thus, BhÀskara was born in Œaka 1036 (452-453 CE) and he wrote his famous work “SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi” in Œaka 1072 (488-489 CE) when he was 36 years old (rasa-guõa-varÈeõa). He also authored THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n128 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “KaraõakutÂhala” around Œaka 1105 (521-522 CE) and referred to Œaka 1105 as KaraõÀbda. According to BhÀskara, there was a Kœaya mÀsa or suppressed month in the Œaka 974 (390-391 CE) and there will be one each in Œaka 1115 (531-532 CE), 1256 (672-673 CE) and 1378 (794-795 CE).37 BhÀskara states that 3179 years of Kali Yuga elapsed when the Œaka king died (nandÀdrÁnduguõÀstathÀ Œaka-nÃpasyÀnte kalervatsarÀÍ) and 1972947179 years including the years of Œaka era elapsed (godrÁndvadrikÃtaôkadasranagagocandrÀÍ ŒakÀbdÀnvitÀÍ)38 which is irrefutable evidence that Œaka era (583 BCE) and the era that commenced from the death of the Œaka king (78 CE) are not the same but two different eras. LallÀchÀrya also states that 3179 years Kaliyuga including the years of Œaka era elapsed in 78 CE. Therefore, BhÀskara’s expression “Œaka- nÃpa-samaye” unambiguously refers to Œaka era (583 BCE) and not “Œaka- nÃpasyÀnte” (78 CE). Thus, BhÀskara was born in 452-453 CE and not in 1114-1115 CE. Alberuni knew about BhÀskara in 1031 CE. He not only mentions about Bhaskaracharya, as the son of MahÀdeva but also his book “KaraõakutÂhala” as a work of astronomy known in his own country for more than a hundred years. In case, KaraõakutÂhala was written in ŒÀlivÀhana 1105 (1183 CE), how could Alberuni have known about it in 1031 CE and in his country since the beginning of the 10th century CE? Thus, it is evident that BhÀskara referred to the Œaka era (583 CE) and not the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Weber, in his book on Sanskrit literature, noticed this anomaly, but was unable to offer any explanation. He honestly accepted: “I confess my inability to solve this riddle; so close is this coincidence as to the personage that the “BhÀskar” of Alberuni is expressly described, like the real BhÀskara, as the son of MahÀdeva”.39 The riddle is now solved because BhÀskara was born in Œaka 1036 (452- 453 CE) not in ŒÀlivÀhana 1036 (1114 CE). Therefore, BhÀskara authored KaraõakutÂhala in Œaka 1105 (522 CE) which was available to Alberuni at the time of his visit. Some scholars argue that Weber suggested that his translation of the Arabic words of Alberuni might be wrong, for Alberuni usually represents the Indian bh by b-h, and for the most part faithfully preserves\n129 the length of the vowels, neither of these is here done in the case of Bashkar, where, moreover, the s is changed into sh”, and adds in a footnote that in the passage under discussion “there lurks not a Bhaskara at all, but perhaps, Pushkara”. Even if the passage refers to a BhÀskara, Weber suggested that “we may have to think of that elder BhÀskara, who was at the head of the commentators of °ryabhaÇa, and is repeatedly cited by PrithÂdakasvÀmin, who was himself anterior to the author of the “SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi”. This entire argument is untenable because there is no credible evidence to prove the existence of fictitious personalities like Pushkara. The so-called elder BhÀskara did not write any treatise on Karaõa. Alberuni clearly mentions that BhÀskara and his work KaraõakutÂhala were known in his country since the beginning of the 10th century CE. Interestingly, Patna inscription,40 which is dated in Œaka 1128 (545 CE), gives the genealogy of Bhaskaracharya. In CE Trivikrama 300-375 CE BhÀskarabhaÇÇa 325-400 CE Govinda 350-425 CE PrabhÀkara 375-450 CE Manoratha 400-475 CE Maheœvara 425-500 CE BhÀskarÀchÀrya 452-532 CE LakœmÁdhara 478-560 CE ChÀôgadeva 505-590 CE According to this inscription, BhÀskarabhaÇÇa, the son of Trivikrama, received the title of “VidyÀpati” from the great king BhojarÀja (Yo BhojarÀjena kÃtÀbhidhÀno VidyÀpatir BhÀskarabhaÇÇa-nÀmÀ). BhÀskarÀchÀrya’s son LakœmÁdhara was the chief astrologer of the YÀdava king Jaitugi or JaitrapÀla and BhÀskarÀchÀrya’s grandson ChÀôgadeva was the chief astrologer of the YÀdava king Siôghaõa. ChÀôgadeva founded a college at Patna village (in Khandesh, Central India) to teach the doctrines promulgated by Bhaskaracharya. THE LITERARY REFERENCES OF ŒAKA ERA\n130 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Interestingly, this inscription records a grant made by Soideva, a feudatory of the YÀdava king Siôghaõa in favour of ChÀôgadeva’s college in Œaka 1128 (545 CE). In view of the above, it can be concluded that Bhaskaracharya was born in Œaka 1036 (452-453 CE) and not in ŒÀlivÀhana 1036 (1114 CE). Unfortunately, the year 2014 was celebrated as the 900th birth year of Bhaskaracharya. Actually, the year 2014 was the 1562nd birth year of Bhaskaracharya. Bhaskaracharya is generally referred to as BhÀskara II by modern scholars because another BhÀskara flourished in the 7th century CE who wrote MahÀbhÀskarÁyam, LaghubhÀskarÁyam and °ryabhaÇÁya-bhÀÈyam. He states in his commentary on °ryabhaÇÁyam that the time elapsed since the beginning of the Kalpa is 1986123730 which implies that he wrote his commentary in the year 3730 elapsed of Kaliyuga i.e. 628-629 CE. Therefore, BhÀskara, the author of SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi must be referred to as BhÀskara I and BhÀskara, the author of MahÀbhÀskarÁyam as BhÀskara II. \u0002\n131 According to the PurÀõas, the Guptas were “ŒriparvatÁyas” (local chiefs at Œriparvata near Nepal) and “°ndhrabhÃtyas” (the officials of ŒÀtavÀhana kings) but originally belonged to the SÂrya VaÚœa Kœatriya lineage. “Ete praõatasÀmantÀÍ ŒrimadguptakulodbhavÀÍ | Œri-ParvatÁyÀndhrabhÃtya-nÀmÀnaœcakravartinaÍ || ”1 It is well known that the rise of the Guptas ended the rule of the ŒÀtavÀhanas. Œrigupta and his son GhaÇotkacha Gupta were the earliest kings of the Gupta dynasty but were either officials or feudatories of the ŒÀtavÀhanas. Chandragupta I, the son of Ghatotkacha Gupta, was the founder of the Gupta Empire and the one who annexed the Magadha kingdom. Some historians speculated that Œrigupta and Ghatotkacha Gupta may have been feudatories of Indo-Scythian kings but there is no evidence to support this argument. Chandragupta I married KumÀradevi, a princess of the king of Nepal who belonged to the the LiccÍavi dynasty. ŒÀtavÀhana king Chandraœri ŒÀtakarõi’s wife was the elder sister of KumÀradevi (LiccÍavÁyÀm samudvÀhya devyÀœcandraœriyo’nujÀm). With the support of the LiccÍavis and being one of their important family members (RÀÈÇrÁya-ŒyÀlako bhÂtvÀ), Chandragupta I not only became the commander-in-chief (SenÀdhyakœa) of the ŒÀtavÀhanas but also controlled the Magadha Empire. With the support of his queen, KumÀradevi’s sister (RÀjapatnyÀ ca coditaÍ), he killed the ŒÀtavÀhana king Chandraœri ŒÀtakarõi under the pretext of acting as the guardian of his minor son PulomÀn III. Thus, Chandragupta I took complete control of the Magadha Empire. Later, he also killed the minor king PulomÀn and founded the mighty empire of the Guptas including the Janapadas of Magadha, SÀketa (AyodhyÀ), PrayÀga, etc. (anugaôgÀm PrayÀgaœca SÀketam MagadhÀôstathÀ).",

    "content": "The Epoch of the Gupta Era\n132 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Chandragupta I shifted the capital of the Magadha Empire from Girivraja to PÀtalÁputra and anointed himself as “MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja”. He founded an era known as the Gupta era which was used in eastern, central and western India. Western historians and their followers propounded that both the Gupta and Valabhi eras commenced in 319-320 CE. Chandragupta I ascended the throne in 319 CE. According to them, it is evidenced from two sources i.e. Alberuni’s account and Mandasor inscription. Alberuni states that the epoch of the Valabhi era falls 241 years after the epoch of ŒakakÀla (ŒÀlivÀhana era) and that the epoch of the era of the Guptas falls like that of the Valabha era, 241 years after ŒakakÀla.2 Therefore, it was concluded that the Valabhi era and the Gupta era were identical. The Mandasor inscription of Bandhuvarman,3 engraved during the reign of the Gupta king KumÀragupta I (KumÀragupte prithivÁm praœÀsati) and dated in the year 493 (436 CE) of the MÀlava-gaõa era (Historians wrongly identified it with the epoch of 57 BCE), supports the contention that the Gupta era commenced in 319 CE. To begin with, Western historians invented the baseless premise that the MÀlava-gaõa (KarttikÀdi Vikrama era) and the Chaitradi Vikrama eras were identical. There is no credible evidence whatsoever to prove this theory. In reality, the MÀlava-gaõa era (KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era) commenced in 719-718 BCE whereas the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. We will discuss the MÀlava-gaõa era (KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era) in detail in",

    "content": ". It may also be noted that the MÀlava- gaõa era was also known as the KÃta era. The Mandasor inscription of Bandhuvarman recorded the date as 493 years elapsed in the MÀlava- gaõa era and 13th tithi of the bright fortnight of Sahasya (PauÈa) month (MalavÀõÀm gaõa-sthityÀ yÀte œata-catuÈÇaye | tri-navatyadhike’bdÀnÀm Ãtau sevya-ghana-svane | Sahasya-mÀsa œuklasya praœaste’hni trayodaœe || ). The 493rd year of the MÀlava-gaõa era elapsed was 226-225 BCE and the date corresponds to 6th December 226 BCE. Alberuni clearly states that “As regards the GuptakÀla (Gubit Kal), people say that the Guptas were wicked, powerful people, and that when they ceased to exist, this date (319 CE) was used as the epoch of an era (tarikh-e-Ballaba = Valabhi era)”. Actually, the Maitraka kings of Valabhi\n133 were feudatories of the Guptas and used the calendar of the Gupta era. When the rule of the Gupta kings ended and the Valabhi kings became independent, a necessity was felt to replace the Gupta era and as it was quite likely that the people of Valabhi hated the Gupta kings, the Valabhi era was introduced in 319 CE in commemoration of some historical event but the Valabhi astronomers retained the most of the features of the calendar of the Gupta era for the convenience of astronomical calculations. For this reason, the calendar of the Gupta era and the calendar of the Valabhi era remained identical. By the 10th century, it appears that the Valabhi people forgot the epoch of the Gupta era and had only the knowledge of the epoch of the Valabhi era. In all likelihood, this state of affairs was communicated to Alberuni in the 11th century but he wrongly construed that the epoch of the Gupta era was identical to the epoch of the Valabhi era. Alberuni himself records that the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE when the Guptas ceased to exist. Therefore, the Valabhi era and the Gupta era are two different eras. The Gupta era undoubtedly commenced during the rule of Chandragupta I whereas the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE when the Gupta Empire ended. This means that the Gupta Empire flourished much before 319 CE. The inscriptions of MahÀrÀja Hastin and Samkœobha4 refer to the Gupta era as “Gupta-nÃpa-rÀjya-bhuktau” meaning “during the reign of the kings of Guptas” clearly indicating that the Gupta era commenced to commemorate the establishment of the rule of Guptas and not to mark the end of the Gupta Empire. Prior to the discovery of the Mandasor inscription, it was generally accepted that the Gupta era commenced much before the epoch of the Valabhi era based on the statement of Alberuni. Edward Thomas opined that the Gupta era was identical to the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). A. Cunningham fixed it as 167 CE while E. Clive Bayley thought it was 190 CE.5 After the discovery of the Mandasor inscription of Bandhuvarman, it was JF Fleet who concocted the idea that MÀvala-gaõa era (KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era) was identical to the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. He also propagated the theory that the Gupta and Valabhi eras were identical and shared the same epoch in 319-320 CE, quite contrary to the statement of Alberuni. THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n134 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 1. Solar eclipse on new moon day of MÀgha month in Gupta SaÚvat 585 elapsed. The date given is 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month.

A solar eclipse was visible on 20th Jan 250 CE between 14:33 hrs to 16:12 hrs. It was the new moon day of MÀgha month. The epoch: 319-320 CE No Solar eclipse in M À g h a month of 903 or 904 or 905 CE. 2. Solar eclipse on new moon day of Chaitra month in Gupta SaÚvat 322. (Chaitra-amÀvÀsyÀyÀm...... grahoparÀge SaÚvatsara-œata-traye dvaviÚœe) (NÀgardhan plates of SwamirÀja)7 The year was 14-13 BCE. A solar eclipse was visible on 29th Mar 14 BCE be- tween 6:40 hrs to 6:55 hrs. The day was the new moon day of Chaitra month. No Solar eclipse on C h a i t r a amÀvÀsyÀ of 640 or 641 or 642 CE It can be construed that the Gupta era and the Valabhi era were altogether different and that the Valabhi era commenced in 319-320 CE when the Guptas ceased to exist. But what then is the epoch of the Gupta era? We have to study the verifiable details of the inscriptions of the Gupta era to determine the real epoch of the Gupta era. The following study of solar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions leads to the conclusion that the epoch of the Gupta era was 335-334 BCE:\n135 3. Solar eclipse on new moon day of VaiœÀkha month in Gupta SaÚvat 254 (257?). (Sam 200 50 4 VaiœÀkha ba 10 5) (Bantia plates of Dharasena I)8 Considering Gupta SaÚvat 254 elapsed, the year was 81-80 BCE.

A solar eclipse was visible on 1st November 34 BCE between 13:37 hrs to 16:25 hrs. No Solar eclipse in 618-619 CE or 619-620 CE. 2nd Sep 620 CE. THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n136 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 1. MÂla nakœatra was crossed over and on 7th day of VaiœÀkha month in Gupta SaÚvat 157 (178-177 BCE). The statement “MÂle saÚpragate” indicates that one tithi before Saptami was associated with MÂla nakœatra. (VaiœÀkha-mÀsa-saptamyÀm MÂle sampragate)10 2. UttarÀyaõa on 11th day of the dark half of MÀgha month in Gupta SaÚvat 250 (86-85 BCE) [MÀgha-kÃÈõasyaikÀdaœyÀm uttarÀyaõe]11 The epoch: 335-334 BCE 3rd April 178 BCE was the Saptami of the dark fortnight of VaiœÀkha and Moon was in MÂla Nakœatra on 2nd April 178 BCE. Kumbha SaÚkrÀnti occurred on 12th Jan 86 BCE and it was the 11th day of the dark half of MÀgha month. The epoch: 319-320 CE Irregular. The date corresponds to 18th Jan 570 CE. Other verifiable details of inscriptions of the Gupta era: Apart from the above, there are two inscriptions that refer to intercalary months12 and six more inscriptions referring to the system of the Twelve Year cycle of Jupiter that is based on the heliacal rising of Jupiter.13 The intercalation system adopted in the Gupta inscriptions differs from the system usually adopted by the available siddhÀntas. We have to study further to find out the intercalation system and the heliacal rising system of Jupiter adopted in the Gupta inscriptions. However, the study of solar eclipses mentioned in the Gupta inscriptions clearly leads us to the epoch of the Gupta era to be around 335-334 BCE. Following are five more instances to prove that the epoch of the Gupta era cannot be fixed in 319-320 CE:\n137 1. A Jain scholar ŒÁlÀcÀrya wrote a commentary on “°cÀrÀôgasÂtra” in the city of GambhÂtÀ (Cambay) on 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in Gupta SaÚvat 772 elapsed. The manuscript of this commentary has recorded the following statement in the folios 207b & 208a. “DvÀ-saptatyadhikeÈu hi œateÈu saptasu gateÈu GuptÀnÀm saÚvatsareÈu mÀsi ca BhÀdrapade œukla paðcamyÀm | ŒÁlÀcÀryeõa kÃtÀ GaÚbhÂtÀyÀm sthitena tÁkaiÈÀ |”14 Interestingly, the same manuscript has recorded the following statement in the last folio (256b) of the book. “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara-œateÈu saptasu aÈÇa-navatyadhikeÈu vaiœÀkha-œuddha-paðcamyÀm °cÀraÇÁkÀ kÃteti |” “This °cÀraÇÁkÀ was written on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of VaiœÀkha month in Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta (ŒÀlivÀhana) era 798 (875-876 CE).” If, in fact, the Gupta era had commenced in 319-320 CE, then these two statements are contradictory. The statement in folio 207b & 208a tells us that ŒÁlÀcÀrya wrote a commentary in 1091- 92 CE (Gupta SaÚvat 772 elapsed) whereas the statement in folio 256b tells us that °cÀraÇÁkÀ was written in 875-876 CE (ŒÀlivÀhana 798). The last statement not only confirms that ŒÁlÀcÀrya existed either prior to 875-876 CE or in 875-876 CE but also clearly indicates that the epoch of the Gupta era in 319- 320 CE is not tenable. Therefore, the Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE as calculated above on the basis of the solar eclipses mentioned in the Gupta inscriptions. Thus, ŒÁlÀcÀrya wrote a commentary on “°cÀrÀôgasÂtra” on BhÀdrapada œukla paðcami in Gupta SaÚvat 772 elapsed i.e. 22nd August 437 CE. It is quite likely that the person who copied the text in his manuscript, may have recorded the date at the end as VaiœÀkha œuddha paðcami of ŒÀlivÀhana 798 i.e. 18th April 875 CE. It is also probable that the manuscript contained two commentaries i.e. one commentary of ŒÁlÀchÀrya written in Gupta SaÚvat 772 (437 CE) and another commentary named “°cÀraÇÁkÀ” written in ŒÀlivÀhana 798 (875- THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n138 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 876 CE). We need to verify this from the original manuscript. This manuscript, however, tells us that Gupta SaÚvat 772 was prior to ŒÀlivÀhana 798. Therefore, the epoch of the Gupta era is logically not possible in 319-320 CE. JF Fleet, the ringmaster of the distortionists, claimed that ŒÁlÀcÀrya treated the Gupta era and the Saka era as identical.15 He also stated that the mistake of ŒÁlÀcÀrya cannot be cleared away, unless we can obtain some independent record of the real date of ŒÁlÀcÀrya. In fact, it was JF Fleet who committed a forgery considering the Gupta era and the Valabhi era as identical well knowing that the Valabhi era commenced when the Guptas no longer existed. The manuscript of the commentary of ŒÁlÀcÀrya unambiguously records two dates, one in the Gupta era and another in the ŒÀlivÀhana era. There is no evidence to prove that ŒÁlÀcÀrya treated the Gupta era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era as identical. It was JF Fleet’s devious mind that concocted the idea that ŒÁlÀcÀrya treated the Gupta era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era as identical so that he could easily sidestep the fact that the Gupta SaÚvat 772 was prior to ŒÀlivÀhana 798. 2. The Gokak grant of the Sendraka king Indrananda16 found in Belgaum district is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 845 elapsed. The Sendraka king Indrananda was the feudatory of the RÀÈÇrakÂta king Dejja MahÀrÀja. If the Gupta era had, in fact, commenced in 319-320 CE, the Gokak grant would be dated in 1164-1165 CE. However, as this grant was written in the Southern script which was in use only up to the 6th century CE and became extinct by the 6th century CE. It is logically not possible to date the Gokak grant after 6th century CE. N Laxminarayan Rao pointed out that this grant was dated in the °guptÀyika era which probably commenced during the rule of Maurya Chandragupta around 312-313 BCE. Therefore, the date of the grant may be fixed in 532-533 CE. DC Sircar mentions that the starting point of the °guptÀyika era was around 200 BCE; but primarily there is no evidence to prove that an era named “°guptÀyika” ever existed. It is clearly a result of baseless\n139 speculations by historians who were completely ignorant of the Sanskrit language. The Gokak plates recorded the following statement: “°guptÀyikÀnÀm rÀjðÀm aÈÇasu varÈa-œateÈu paðca-catvÀriÚœad- agreÈu gateÈu.....” Here, the phrase “°guptÀyikÀnÀm rÀjðÀm” has been derived as “Gupta” iti khyÀtaÍ GuptÀyikaÍ, teÈÀm GuptÀyikÀnÀm rÀjðÀm, tÀn Àrabhya °guptÀyikÀnÀm rÀjðÀm. Thus, “°guptÀyikÀnÀm rÀjðÀm” means “from the starting year of the kings named as the Guptas”. Therefore, the statement recorded in the Gokak plates means that “When forty five years after eight hundred years elapsed from the starting point of the kings named as the Guptas”. Thus, the Gokak plates clearly referred to the Gupta era and not to any fictitious era named “°guptÀyika”. As it was clearly proved above that the Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE, therefore the date of the Gokak grant must be fixed in 510-511 CE (Gupta SaÚvat 845 elapsed). The date mentioned in the Gokak grant is also irrefutable evidence which supports the fact that the Gupta era commenced much before 319-320 CE. 3. Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, a treatise written around the 9th or 10th century CE, gives the account of the history of Indian kings based on the PurÀõas and the chronology of the dynasties of the kings with reference to the movement of the Great Bear (SaptarÈi Mandal). According to this treatise, the rule of Gupta Dynasty ended when the Great Bear was in Punarvasu constellation. “YadÀ Punarvasum yÀsyantyete saptarÈayaÍ punaÍ | Tada Œri-GuptavaÚœÀnÀm rÀÈÇraÚtvanyam gamiÈyati || ”17 “By the time the Great Bear reaches Punarvasu constellation again, the empire of Gupta dynasty will pass to others.” The Great Bear stays hundred years in each constellation of the 27 nakœatras. Thus, it takes 2700 years to complete one cycle. It was in Punarvasu constellation again during the period 176 THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n140 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA BCE-76 BCE. The Gupta kings ruled for a minimum of 225 years to a maximum of 255 years. Considering the epoch of the Gupta Era in 335 BCE, the rule of the Guptas ended between 110 BCE to 80 BCE. This confirms that the epoch of the Gupta era undoubtedly commenced in 335 BCE. If the epoch of the Gupta era was indeed in 319-320 CE, then the rule of the Guptas ought to have ended around 550 CE but the Great Bear was in RevatÁ constellation during the period 524-624 CE clearly proving that the epoch of the Gupta era cannot be explained in 319-320 CE. 4. A Valabhi grant of Dharasenadeva is dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 400 (478 CE) in which Maitraka king Dharasenadeva, the son of Guhasena II calls himself as Sovereign King “MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja Parameœvara ParamabhaÇÇÀraka”. According to other Valabhi grants, the Maitrakas of Valabhi were feudatories of the Guptas and used the Gupta era. It is impossible to fix the date of Dharasenadeva in 478 CE considering the epoch of the Gupta era in 319-320 CE. Therefore, Western historians, without any credible evidence, rejected this grant to be a forgery. In fact, Dharasenadeva, who ruled around 478 CE, was the last known king of Maitrakas. The last grant of the Valabhi king ŒÁlÀditya VII is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 447 which means that the Gupta era commenced at least 447 years before the rule of Dharasenadeva. 5. The Dhiniki grant of Jaikadeva II, the Saindhava ruler of Saurashtra, was dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 794 (737 CE) whereas one grant of Jaika II is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 596. Jaika II did not mention Jaikadeva in his genealogy. Dr. AS Altekar rejected this grant as a forgery considering the epoch of the Gupta era in 319 CE and Jaika II to be later then Jaikadeva. However, this can be easily explained if we consider the Gupta era as earlier than 319 CE. Actually, Jaika II flourished in the 3rd century CE whereas Jaikadeva flourished in the 8th century CE. This explains why, Jaika II did not mention about Jaikadeva in his genealogy and also proves the Dhiniki grant to be absolutely genuine.\n141 Thus, the epoch of the Gupta era must be fixed in 335-334 BCE and it commenced during the reign of Chandragupta I, the founder of Gupta Empire. The rise of the Gupta Dynasty Chandragupta I (338-331 BCE): According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta,18 Chandragupta I killed the ŒÀtavÀhana king Chandraœri ŒÀtakarõi and his minor son PulomÀn III and proclaimed himself the Emperor of Magadha. He ruled for seven years and founded the Gupta era in 335- 334 BCE. It appears that Chandragupta I killed ŒÀtavÀhana king Chandraœri ŒÀtakarõi and Puloman III by 338 BCE and ascended the throne in Girivraja (Rajgir). Later, he shifted the capital from Girivraja to PuÈpapura known as PÀtalÁputra in 335 BCE and founded the Gupta era. His regnal title was “VijayÀditya”. “Chandraœriyam ghÀtayitvÀ miÈeõaiva hi kenacit | tatputrapratibhÂtvam ca rÀjye caiva niyojitaÍ || ..... Tatputram ca PulomÀnam vinihatya nÃpÀrbhakam || VijayÀdityanÀmna tu sapta pÀlayitÀ samÀÍ | svanÀmna ca œakam tvekam sthÀpayiÈyati bhÂtale || ” Samudragupta (331-280 BCE): Chandragupta I selected his son Kacha as YuvarÀja of the Gupta Empire but Samudragupta, his eldest son by the LiccÍavi princess KumÀradevi, revolted against his father. Ultimately, Samudragupta had to kill his father and his half-brother Kacha and became the MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja of the Gupta Empire. He ruled for a long period of 51 years. His regnal title was “AœokÀditya”. The NÀlanda grant of Samudragupta is the earliest inscription dated in Gupta SaÚvat 5 (331-330 BCE). The Gaya grant of Samudragupta is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 9 (327-326 BCE). According to the NÀlanda grant, Samudragupta was ruling in Gupta SaÚvat 5 which means Chandragupta I had died by then. The PurÀõas tell us that Chandragupta I ruled for seven years. Therefore, it can be construed that Chandragupta I founded the Gupta era at the end of his 3rd regnal year. Surprisingly, eminent historians arbitrarily assumed that Chandragupta I ruled for around 16 to 20 years despite contrary epigraphic and literary evidence. JF Fleet declared the NÀlanda and Gaya grants “spurious” due to minor grammatical mistakes in the language. He also observed that some THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n142 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA of the characters of these inscriptions were antique and some were comparatively modern. There are numerous inscriptions which contain minor grammatical mistakes and cannot, therefore, be the basis to evaluate the genuineness of the epigraphs. Fleet’s palaeography, which is based on distorted chronology, cannot qualify to be the yardstick to fix the dates of epigraphs. JF Fleet and his followers concocted the idea that there were some forged copper plate inscriptions to justify their distorted chronology. Fleet used this idea selectively to reject certain inscriptions which were not in line with his distorted chronology. Deliberately, Western historians propagated the myth of the existence of forged copper plate inscriptions to suit their nefarious designs. I challenge historians to put forth some credible evidence other than Fleet’s distorted palaeography to prove the myth of the existence of forged copper plate inscriptions. Samudragupta was the most ambitious king and the greatest warrior among the Guptas, thus, making him the most powerful emperor of India at that time. According to the Allahabad pillar inscription19 composed by the great poet HariÈeõa, Samudragupta defeated eleven kings of DakœiõÀpatha i.e. South India including king Mahendra of Kosala, the Pallava king ViÈõugopa of KÀðchi, the ŒÀlaôkÀyana king Hastivarman of Veôgi, etc. and nine kings of °ryÀvartha i.e. Central and Northern India. It is also recorded that the Devaputras of ŒÀhÁ- ŒÀhÀnuœÀhi, the Northern Œaka Kœatrapas, the Muruôças and the Yavanas of Afghanistan also acknowledged his supremacy. Eastern kingdoms like SamataÇa, DÀvaka, KÀmarÂpa (Assam) and Nepal also became his tributary provinces. Thus, Samudragupta established the authority of the Gupta Empire in Eastern, Southern (up to KÀðchi) and Central India and in the Western frontier provinces of Devaputra ŒÀhÁ- ŒÀhÀnuœÀhis, Œakas, Muruôças and also in SiÚhala (Sri Lanka). Who was Sandrokottus: Samudragupta or Chandragupta Maurya? Alexander, during his invasion of the Persian Empire and some parts of western India, had a few Greek scholars like Baeto, Diognetos, Nearchos, Onesikritos, Aristoboulos, and Kallisthenes in his entourage\n143 to chronicle his achievements. Megasthanes and Deimachos, the ambassadors of Seleucus Nikator the successor of Alexander, also wrote about India. Though the works of these scholars are all lost, their substance is found in the works of Plutarch, Strabo, Pliny and Arrian. Plutarch wrote Alexander’s biography over 400 years after the death of Alexander based on oral legends. These Greek scholars repeatedly mentioned a powerful king of India named “Sandrokottus” who was undoubtedly “Samudragupta” with reference to the epoch of Gupta era in 335 BCE and Puranic account of the history of Magadha. William Jones (1746-1794) deliberately identified “Sandrokottus” mentioned by the Greeks as Chandragupta Maurya and declared that he was the contemporary of Alexander in 327-326 BCE. This concocted theory of William Jones has been propagated by Western historians as an eternal and irrefutable historical fact in constructing the chronology of ancient India. Eminent Indian historians under the influence of western historians toed the same line. Unfortunately, they completely ignored the history of ancient India as recorded in PurÀõas since the MahÀbhÀrata war. Considering the epoch of the Œaka era in 583 BCE and the epoch of the Gupta era in 335 BCE, the epigraphic evidence supports the fact that the Maurya dynasty ruled Magadha much before the 4th century BCE. PurÀõas tell us that Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne by defeating the last Nanda king around 1516 BCE. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, the Great Bear or SaptarÈi Mandal was in Œravaõa nakœatra during the reign of MahÀpadma Nanda. “SaptarÈayo MaghÀyuktÀÍ kÀle YaudhiÈÇhire œatam | Œravaõe te bhaviÈyanti kÀle Nandasya bhÂpateÍ || ”20 (During the time of YudhiÈÇhira, the Great Bear was in MaghÀ constellation for 100 years. By the time of Nanda, it will be in Œravaõa constellation.) The Great Bear was in Œravaõa nakœatra around 1676 BCE to 1576 BCE. The Nanda dynasty ruled Magadha for 100 years between 1616 BCE to 1516 BCE. We will discuss the chronology of the Nandas and the Mauryas in detail in",

Therefore, Samudragupta was the contemporary of Alexander in 327-326 BCE and not Chandragupta THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n144 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Maurya. There is much more evidence to support that the fact that it was Samudragupta who was “Sandrokottus” and not Chandragupta Maurya: 1. The Greek scholars recorded the names of the kings of India as Xandrames and Sandrokottus. Western historians deliberately identified these names with those of MahÀpadmananda or Dhanananda and Chandragupta Maurya. Xandrames was said to be the father of Sandrokottus. According to John W. McCrindle, Diodorus distorted the name “Sandrokottus” into Xandrames and this was again distorted by Curtius into Agrammes.21 It is totally absurd to link Xandrames with MahÀpadmananda and Sandrokottus with Chandragupta Maurya. Most probably, the Greeks called Chandra (Chandragupta) as Xandrames and Samudragupta. as Sandrokottus. Moreover, the description given by the Greek scholars about Sandrokottus and his father Xandrames are quite inapplicable to Chandragupta Maurya and could only apply to Samudragupta. According to the Greeks, Xandrames was the king of Gangaridai and PrÀsii whereas Dhanananda was the ruler of entire north, west, central and eastern India. It is also said that Sandrokottus (Samudragupta) killed his father Xandrames (Chandragupta). This fact has been wilfully ignored by biased western historians and their followers. 2. All Greek writers mention Sandrokottus, the king of PrÀsii, whose capital was Palibothra i.e. PÀtalÁputra. Megasthanes, Deimachos and other Greek ambassadors of Seleucus Nikator were sent to the court of Samudragupta and Chandragupta II at Palibothra. PÀtalÁputra became the capital of the Magadha Empire only during the reign of Chandragupta I around 335 BCE. According to the PurÀõas, Girivraja or RÀjagÃha (Rajgir) was the capital city of Magadha during the reign of the Nandas and the Mauryas. Thus, PÀtalÁputra was not the capital city of Chandragupta Maurya. From 3rd century BCE onwards, the city of PÀtalÁputra became famous as the capital of Magadha. This is the reason why ViœÀkhadatta referred the PÀtalÁputra as the capital city of the Magadha Empire in his work “MudrÀrÀkœasa”\n145 but this cannot be taken as evidence to reject the Puranic reference. Moreover, MudrÀrÀkœasa is a drama based on historical fiction. All the PurÀõas unanimously tell us that the capital of the Magadha Empire was Girivraja or RÀjagÃha till the fall of the ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty. 3. According to Megasthanes, the Œakas or Skythians were living in the northern side of India. “India, which is in shape quadrilateral, has its eastern as well as its western side bounded by the great sea but on the northern side it is divided by Mount Hemodos from that part of Skythia which is inhabited by those Skythians who are called the Œakai, while the fourth or western side is bounded by the river called the Indus, which is perhaps the largest of all rivers in the world after the Nile.”22 As many other Greek scholars also wrote about the Skythians, it is quite evident that the Northern Œaka Kœatrapas were ruling in the North-western frontier region during the time of Megasthanes. It is well known that the Œaka Kœatrapas were contemporaries of the Guptas and not the Mauryas. Aœoka inscriptions mention only Yavana kings named Antikina, Alikasundara, Maga, Turamaya and Gongakena (not Greeks but indigenous Yavana kings of Afganistan and Northern Pakistan) as ruling in the western frontier regions. Western historians speculated that these kings may be Antiochus Theos II of Syria, Alexander of Epirus, Magas of Cyrene, Ptolemy II Philadelphos of Egypt and Antigonus Gonatus of Macedonia. These baseless speculations were simply based on the resemblance of names without any direct or indirect evidence. The references to the Yavana kings in the Aœoka inscriptions indicate that the Yavanas were the rulers of the western frontier regions during the Mauryan era, and not the Œakas. There is no reference to the Œaka Kœatrapas in the entire account of Mauryan history. Therefore, Sandrokottus can only be Samudragupta who was the contemporary of the Œaka Kœatrapas and not Chandragupta Maurya. THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n146 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 4. Seleucus Nikator also sent Deimachos on an embassy to Allitrocades or Amitrocades, the son of Sandrokottus.23 Western historians identified Allitrocades or Amitrocades to be Bindusara, the son of Chandragupta and concocted the fiction that BindusÀra was also known as “AmitraghÀta”. None of the Indian sources ever referred to BindusÀra as AmitraghÀta. Western historians deliberately created the word “AmitraghÀta” to deceive with some sort of resemblance. According to the PurÀõas, Samudragupta was also known as “AœokÀditya” and Chandragupta II was also known as “VikramÀditya”.24 Probably, Allitrocades or Amitrocades referred to “VikramÀditya”, the son of Sandrokottus (Samudragupta). 5. Megasthanes describes the system of city administration of PÀtalÁputra but there is no similarity between the system described by Megasthanes and the system of city administration given in the Kautilya ArthaœÀstra. Megasthanes also stated that there was no slavery in India but Kautilya ArthaœÀstra’s",

    "content": "named “DÀsakalpa” is solely devoted to the status of slaves among the °ryans and the MleccÍas.25 Probably, the slavery system that existed during the Mauryan era had gradually declined by the time of the Gupta era. Thus, Megasthanes cannot be a contemporary of Chandragupta Maurya. 6. Megasthanes, who was a frequent visitor to Palibothra, but also stayed in the court of Sandrokottus for a few years. But not once has he mentioned Kautilya, also known as ChÀõakya who was the real kingmaker and the patron of Chandragupta. In fact, no other Greek scholar has ever mentioned Kautilya. Therefore, Megasthanes cannot be a contemporary of Chandragupta Maurya. 7. Greek scholars often refer to Sandrokottus as being the king of the country called as PrÀsii (PrÀcÁ or PrÀcya). PrÀcya or PrÀsii means eastern country. During the Nanda and Mauryan eras, the Magadha kings reigned over almost the entire country. The Mauryan Empire was never referred to in Indian sources as PrÀcya deœa or eastern country. PrÀcya deœa was generally\n147 referred to as the Gupta Empire because the Northern Œaka Kœatrapas and the Western Œaka Kœatrapas were well established in North and West India. Megasthanes mentions that Sandrokottus was the greatest king of the Indians and that Poros was even greater than Sandrokottus26 which meant that a kingdom in the North-western region was still independent and with a status that was at least equal to the kingdom of Sandrokottus. Chandragupta Maurya and his successors being the most powerful kings of India, it is impossible to think of any other Indian king of equal status with the Mauryan kings because the Mauryans inherited a vast and mighty empire from the Nandas. Therefore, Sandrokottus, the king of PrÀsii can only be Samudragupta and not Chandragupta Maurya. 8. The Greek historian Plutarch mentions that Androkottus (Sandrokottus) marched over the whole of India with an army of 600 thousand men. Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Nandas under the leadership of ChÀõakya. There was no need for him to go on such an expedition to conquer the whole of India because he had already inherited the Magadha kingdom of the Nandas covering entire India. Actually, it was Samudragupta who overran the whole of India according to the details given in the Allahabad pillar inscription.27 9. According to Greek historians like Justinus, Appianus etc., Seleukos built friendly ties with Sandrokottus and entered into relations of marriage with him.28 The Allahabad pillar inscription tells us that the kings of the North-West region offered their daughters in marriage to Samudragupta (KanyopÀyanadÀna...). There is nothing in Indian sources to prove this fact with reference to Chandragupta Maurya. 10. The Jain work “HarivaÚœa” written by Jinasena gives the names of the dynasties and kings along with the duration of their rule since the time of the nirvÀõa of MahÀvira. Jinasena mentions nothing about the Mauryas but he tells us that the Gupta kings ruled for 231 years. Western historians fixed the date of THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n148 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA MahÀvira-nirvÀõa in 527 BCE which means that the Mauryas ruled after MahÀvira-nirvÀõa but Jaina PurÀõas and Jaina PattÀvalis had no knowledge of the Mauryas after MahÀvira- nirvÀõa. Thus, Mauryas ruled prior to MahÀvira-nirvÀõa. Therefore, Sandrokottus can only be identified with Samudragupta. The date of MahÀvira-nirvÀõa will be discussed in Chapters 5 & 7. 11. If Sandrokottus was indeed Chandragupta Maurya, why do none of the Greek sources mention about Aœoka, the most illustrious and greatest of Mauryan kings? It is evident that Greek sources had no knowledge of Aœoka. Therefore, the ancient Greeks were contemporaries of the Gupta kings and not the Mauryas. In view of the above, Samudragupta was the contemporary of Alexander and not Chandragupta Maurya. Unfortunately, this distorted history has been taught to Indians since the last 231 years. Indian historians also blindly followed the footsteps of Western historians. Western historians were born and brought up in a Christian society and therefore, faithful to the Biblical conception of the creation of the world in 4004 BCE. They knew the fact that the antiquity of Greece and other European countries was not older than 1000 BCE. When they encountered the fact that the antiquity of Indian civilisation is greater than 6776 BCE, they could not swallow it. Therefore, they started distorting the chronology of ancient India. First of all, William Jones conspired and deliberately cut down 1200 years of Indian history by identifying Sandrokottus as Chandragupta Maurya. To cover up this distortion, Jones declared that the Puranic account of Indian history is mythological and unreliable but selectively accepted the genealogy of various dynasties from the PurÀõas. Actually, many Western historians pursued their research with the objective of curtailing the antiquity of the chronology of ancient India so that the supremacy of ancient Greek civilization could be established. Western historians were fascinated with the history of Alexander from their childhood. They started searching for the footprints of Alexander’s invasion in India. Interestingly, there is no reference of\n149 Alexander’s invasion in Indian literary sources because it was actually a non-event for Indians. Western scholars concocted the theory that the Yavanas mentioned in Indian sources are Greeks. According to various Indian sources, Yavana kingdoms existed in Indian history since the MahÀbhÀrata war that located in the west and north sides of the Indus River. Thus, Indian Yavanas were more ancient than the birth of ancient Greek civilisation. In fact, it can be confidently stated that the great victory of Alexander and the homesickness of Greek soldiers were concocted by historians of Alexander who were employed by him to chronicle his achievements. Probably, the army of Alexander was comprehensively defeated by the Indian king Poros and the wounded Alexander and his army had to flee through the channels of Indus River and they landed on the shores of Arabian Sea. They were then forced to march along the dry MakrÀn and Persian Gulf coast and somehow finally, made it back to Babylonia where the wounded young Alexander died in 323 BCE at the age of 33 years. It may be noted that Alexander employed the historians to chronicle his victories not the defeats. Therefore, Greek historians concocted that the victorious army of Alexander fell homesick and feigned the ignorance of geography for the return journey through the channels of Indus River. It is unbelievable that the victorious army of Alexander fell homesick otherwise they could have amassed unimaginable wealth from India, the most prosperous country of the world of the times. Moreover, Megasthanes, who was sent as ambassador to King Poros by Seleukos, mentions that Poros was even greater than Sandrokottus. If Poros was defeated and appointed as satrap by Alexander, how could he become greater than Sandrokottus? After the death of Alexander, his generals decided to divide his Empire among themselves but interestingly, no part of India east of the Indus River was included as part of Alexander’s Empire. Therefore, it seems that the victory of Alexander over the Indian king Poros, the homesickness of his army and the ignorance of geography were just concocted stories by paid Greek historians of Alexander. Strabo once stated: “Generally speaking, the men who have hitherto written on the affairs of India were a set of liars. Deimachos holds the first place in the list; Megasthanes comes next; while Onesikritos and Nearchos with THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n150 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA others of the same class, manage to stammer out a few words of truth.”29 As quoted by Kota Venkatachalam, Troyer also rejected the identification of Chandragupta Maurya with Sandrokottus and pointed out that one of the Chandraguptas of the Gupta dynasty should be taken as Sandrokottus.30 If Samudragupta is accepted as Sandrokottus the contemporary Indian king of Alaxander and the epoch of Œaka coronation era in 583 BCE as discussed in",

    "content": ", there will be no conflict in the traditional Indian records and epigraphic records. Moreover, we need not declare certain copper plate inscriptions “forgeries”. Unfortunately, the Eurocentric and distortionist approach of Western historians caused extreme damage to the chronology of ancient India. These intellectuals having no integrity pursued their research by distorting and concocting numerous so-called historical facts which are nothing less than “fraud”. The Gupta Empire after Samudragupta Samudragupta was the greatest king of the Gupta dynasty whose authority ran from KÀðchi in the South to the HimÀlayas in the North and from KÀmarÂpa (Assam) and entire Bengal on the East to Yamuna and Chambal on the West. He also performed the Aœvamedha ritual to proclaim his supremacy. Samudragupta had two sons namely RÀmagupta and Chandragupta II. RÀmagupta (279-278 BCE): Three VidiœÀ stone image inscriptions31 indicate that RÀmagupta succeeded his father Samudragupta but he ruled for a very short period. The “NÀtyadarpaõa” of RÀmachandra Guõachandra tells us that RÀmagupta was the successor of Samudragupta. According to a Sanskrit drama “DevÁchandraguptam” written by ViœÀkhadutta, RÀmagupta was besieged by a Œaka ruler in the course of a war. RÀmagupta had to agree to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi but his brother Chandragupta II could not tolerate this humiliating agreement. He decided to go to the enemy’s camp in the guise of the queen in order to kill the Œaka king. He succeeded in his plan and freed his brother RÀmagupta but the reputation of RÀmagupta suffered a lot. Gradually, this resulted in enmity between the brothers. Ultimately, Chandragupta II killed his brother RÀmagupta and became the king of Gupta Empire. He also married RÀmagupta’s wife\n151 Dhruvadevi. BÀõabhatta’s Harshacharita also mentions that Chandragupta, in the guise of female, killed the Œaka king at the capital city of the enemy. Chandragupta II (278-242 BCE): Chandragupta II was the son of Samudragupta and Dattadevi. His regnal title was “VikramÀditya”. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, Chandragupta II ruled for 36 years which is in conformity with his inscriptions dated between Gupta SaÚvat 61(274 BCE) and 93 (242 BCE). Probably, the Mathura inscription of Chandragupta II was dated in his 5th regnal year and Gupta SaÚvat 61. He defeated the Western Œaka kœatraps and advanced to the Arabian Sea and subjugated the peninsula of SaurÀÈÇra or KÀÇhiÀwÀr. Chandragupta II married Dhruvadevi and also KuveranÀgÀ of the NÀga family. KumÀragupta I was born to Dhruvadevi whereas the daughter PrabhÀvati Gupta was born to KuveranÀgÀ. PrabhÀvati Gupta was married off to the VÀkÀtaka king Rudrasena II. PrabhÀvati Gupta’s son the VÀkÀtaka king Pravarasena II referred to his maternal grandfather Chandragupta II as Devagupta.32 The King Chandra mentioned in the Mehrauli iron pillar inscription33 is generally identified as Chandragupta II who conquered BÀhlikas after crossing “the seven mouths of the river Sindhu”. In my opinion, King Chandra of the Mehrauli inscription may not be Chandragupta II because there is no supporting evidence that he ever conquered the BÀhlika king crossing the Indus River. The script of inscription also suggests that it may have been written around 600-500 BCE. Probably, the king Chandra was the ruler of the NÀga dynasty in VidiœÀ region and flourished at least 200 years before Vindhyaœakti, the founder of VÀkÀtaka dynasty as recorded in the Puranas34 (Bhogo bhaviÈyate rÀjÀ nÃpo NÀgakulodvahaÍ | SadÀcandrastu ChandrÀœo dvitÁyo NakhavÀnstathÀ ||). It is also wrongly believed that the Chinese pilgrim FÀhien visited India during the reign of Chandragupta II. FÀhien visited India around 399-411 CE whereas Chandragupta II ruled in the 3rd century BCE. KumÀragupta I (241-199 BCE): KumÀragupta was the son of Chandragupta II and Dhruvadevi. His regnal title was “MahendrÀditya”. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, KumÀragupta I ruled for 42 years which is in conformity with his inscriptions dated between Gupta SaÚvat THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n152 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 96 (239 BCE) and 129 (206 BCE). His silver coins give his last date as Gupta SaÚvat 136 (199 BCE). He had two sons, Purugupta and Skandagupta. It appears that KumÀragupta I had a younger brother named Govindagupta. According to one Mandasor inscription35 of King PrabhÀkara, Chandragupta II’s son Govindagupta was ruling in central India in MÀlava-gaõa era (KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era) 524 (194 BCE). Another Mandasor inscription of Bandhuvarman36 was engraved and placed in the temple of Sun during the reign of KumÀragupta I. This inscription is dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 493. JF Fleet assumed that the MÀlava-gaõa era and the Chaitradi Vikrama era (57 BCE) share the same epoch in 57 BCE. Actually, the MÀlava-gaõa era (KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era) also named as KÃta era commenced in 719-718 BCE which means 661 years before the commencement of ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). We will discuss the MÀlava-gaõa and KÃta era in detail in",

    "content": ". Thus, the inscription of Bandhuvarman is dated in MÀlava- gaõa 493 (226-225 BCE) and the inscription was engraved on 6th December 226 BCE. Interestingly, the second inscription, which is dated in 529 elapsed, has been engraved as an addendum to the inscription of Bandhuvarman. This inscription was composed by VatsabhaÇÇi on the occasion of renovation of the temple. VatsabhaÇÇi did not mention the era in which the date was recorded or the name of the ruling king but he unambiguously tells us that when a considerable long time has passed away and some other kings also have passed away, one part of this temple shattered; hence this whole edifice of the Sun was again renovated by the magnanimous guild (BahunÀ samatÁtena kÀlenÀnyaiœca pÀrthivaiÍ | vyaœÁryadaikadeœo’sya bhavanasya tato’dhunÀ || ). Historians concocted that one part of the temple was damaged in lightening because it is highly impossible that a newly built temple went into renovation within 36 years. VatsabhaÇÇi clearly tells us that one part of the temple shattered after a considerable long period. Eminent historians accepted that VatsabhaÇÇi’s inscription is dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 529 (472 CE). Actually, the statement of VatsabhaÇÇi clearly indicates that a considerable long time passed and that some other kings also passed away after Bandhuvarman and\n153 KumÀragupta I. Bandhuvarman was the son of Viœvavarman. The earliest inscription of Viœvavarman37 is dated in MÀlava-gaõa 480. Bandhuvarman would have ascended the throne as the ruler of DÀsapura (Mandasor) around MÀlava-gaõa 492. KumÀragupta II was ruling up to Gupta SaÚvat 136 (MÀlava-gaõa 519). Undoubtedly, Skandagupta was the ruler in MÀlava-gaõa 529. Therefore, Bandhuvarman and Kumaragupta II may have passed away by MÀlava-gaõa 529 but this does not justify the statement of VatsabhaÇÇi. Actually, there is a gap of 36 years between Malava-gana 493 to 529 which means VatsabhaÇÇi was born during the reign of Bandhuvarman. If so, it is illogical to say that a considerable long time passed and that some other kings also passed away. Thus, it can be concluded that VatsabhaÇÇi did not refer to the MÀlava-gaõa era. Most probably, VatsabhaÇÇi referred to the Œaka era (583 BCE). Therefore, VatsabhaÇÇi’s inscription was engraved on the 2nd day of the bright fortnight of the PhÀlguna (Tapasya) month in Saka 529 elapsed (11th February 53 BCE) whereas Bandhuvarman’s inscription was engraved on 13th day of the bright half of PuÈya (Sahasya) month in MÀlava-gaõa 493 elapsed (6th December 226 BCE). Thus, there was a gap of 171 years between Malava- gana 493 to Œaka 529 which fully justifies the statement of VatsabhaÇÇi. Moreover, VatsabhaÇÇi’s poetry indicates that he was conversant not only with the “MeghadÂtam” but also with the “ãitusaÚhÀram” of KÀlidÀsa. KÀlidÀsa’s influence on VatsabhaÇÇi is well known to the Indologists. As discussed in",

    "content": ", KÀlidÀsa was in the court of Ujjain king VikramÀditya and his lifetime can be fixed between 105 BCE to 25 BCE. Therefore, VatsabhaÇÇi was a contemporary of KÀlidÀsa. Skandagupta (199-177 BCE): Skandagupta was the son of KumÀragupta I. His regnal title was “ParÀkramÀditya”. It appears that Skandagupta himself led the army against the HÂõas and defeated them during the reign of his father KumÀragupta I as recorded in the Bhitari inscription38 found in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, Skandagupta ruled for 25 years. The SÀranÀth inscriptions39 of KumÀragupta II and Budhagupta are dated in Gupta SaÚvat 154 (181 BCE) and 157 (178 BCE) respectively but Budhagupta was mentioned as “MahÀrÀjadhirÀja” only in Gupta SaÚvat 159 (176 BCE) onwards.40 THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n154 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA According to the JÂnÀgarh inscription41 of Skandagupta, the embankment of the Sudarœana lake in SaurÀÈÇra burst due to incessant rains in Gupta SaÚvat 136 (199 BCE). It went into major repair works during the reign of Western Œaka Kœatrapa RudradÀman I in Œaka 72 (511 BCE). Skandagupta’s Governor in SaurÀÈÇra named ChakrapÀlita, the son of Parõadatta, undertook the task of repairing Sudarœana lake and completed it by Gupta SaÚvat 137 (198 BCE). The decline of the Gupta Empire The Gupta Empire began to decline after the death of Skandagupta. Skandagupta had no heir of his own and adopted NarasiÚhagupta BÀlÀditya, the son of his half-brother Purugupta or Sthiragupta PrakÀœÀditya and Chandradevi. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta,42 Sthiragupta (Purugupta) and NarasiÚhagupta ruled for 40 years from 176 BCE to 136 BCE. “Tato NÃsiÚhaguptaœca BÀlÀditya iti œrutaÍ | putraÍ PrakÀœÀdityasya Sthiraguptasya bhÂpateÍ || NiyuktaÍ svapitÃvyena Skandaguptena JÁvatÀ | Pitraiva sÀkam bhavitÀ catvÀriÚœat samÀÍ nÃpaÍ || ” Epigraphic evidence suggests that Budhagupta, probably the elder son of Purugupta and Chandradevi, also ruled between Gupta SaÚvat 157 (178 BCE) to 168 (167 BCE). Probably, Budhagupta and NarasiÚhagupta jointly ruled the Gupta Empire under the guidance of their father Purugupta after the death of Skandagupta. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, KumÀragupta II, the son of NarasiÚhagupta and Mittradevi, ruled for 44 years from 136 BCE to 92 BCE. His regnal title was “KramÀditya”. KumÀragupta II defeated the Maukhari king IœÀnavarman. The Haraha (Barabanki, UP) stone inscription43 of SÂryavarman (son of IœÀnavarman) is dated in KÃta era 611 (107 BCE). It may be noted that the KÃta or MÀlava-gaõa era commenced in 719-718 BCE whereas Western historians wrongly identified it to be ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). KumÀragupta II was also in regular conflict with the HÂõas.\n155 “AnyaÍ KumÀragupto’pi putrastasya mahÀyaœÀÍ | KramÀditya iti khyÀto HÂõairyuddham samÀcaran || VijityeœÀnavarmÀdÁn BhatÀrkenÀnusevitaÍ | catuœcatvÀriÚœadeva samÀÍ bhokÈyati medinÁm || ” It seems that the Maukhari king IœÀnavarman established his kingdom around 130-100 BCE.",

IœÀnavarman took advantage of the declining Gupta Empire because the Gupta kings were in regular conflict with the HÂõas. Despite the fact that KumÀragupta II had defeated IœÀnavarman once, he could not stop the gradual disintegration of the Gupta Empire. The meteoric rise of Yasodharman44 in MÀlava region in MÀlava- gaõa era 589 (129 BCE) is also another example of the declining Gupta Empire. KumÀragupta II was succeeded by his son Vishnugupta. Damodarpur grant45 of Vishnugupta is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 224 (111 BCE). According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, the Gupta Empire disintegrated completely by the end of the rule of KumÀragupta II (MagadhÀnÀm mahÀrÀjyam cÍinnam bhinnam ca sarvaœaÍ). The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang visited India around 630-645 CE. Historians wrongly believed that Hiuen Tsang arrived in India when the Gupta Empire declined. Actually, the Gupta Empire declined at least 700 years before the arrival of Hiuen Tsang. Therefore, it is absurd to interpret some of his statements as historical accounts of the Guptas. Hiuen Tsang states that ŒakrÀditya’s son was Budhagupta and he was succeeded by Ta-ta-ka-to-ku-to. After Ta-ta-ka-to-ku-to, his son BÀlÀditya II succeeded to the throne whose son was Fa-she-lo. Historians THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n156 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA speculated ŒakrÀditya as KumÀragupta and Ta-ta-ka-to-ku-to as TathÀgatagupta etc. It is just a distortion of Hiuen Tsang’s statements to prove that ŒakrÀditya and TathÀgatagupta of the 6th century belonged to the Gupta dynasty so that the epoch of the Gupta era can be established in 319 CE. The Chinese pilgrim I-tsing travelled in India around 671-695 CE. He referred to a king named Chi-li-ki-to who ruled five hundred years before his time as having built a temple exclusively for Chinese priests. Some historians deliberately speculated Chi-li-ki-to to be Œrigupta so that the rule of the Guptas can be established in the 4th century CE. Surprisingly, Western historians concocted that Meghavarõa, the king of Cylon, was a contemporary of Samudragupta without any evidence. Moreover, the date of Meghavarõa is itself uncertain. Kashi Prasad Jaiswal in his “History of India” (p. 115) came to the conclusion from a Sanskrit drama named “Kaumudi Mahotsava” that the Varmans (Sundaravarman, KalyÀnavarman, etc.) were ruling Magadha around the 4th century CE. According to Chinese historians, Yung-nai, an Indian king of Kiapili, sent his ambassadors to China in 428 CE.46 Some scholars identified “Yung-nai” with Yagðavarman. If the Gupta era had indeed commenced in 319 CE, KumÀragupta I was the king around 428 CE and not Yagðavarman. It is evident that the Chinese sources of the 4th to 6th centuries do not provide any evidence to prove that the Guptas ruled around the 4th to the 6th century. Western historians said that the later Gupta kings replaced the imperial Guptas based on the Shahpur and Aphsad stone inscriptions of Adityasena.47 These scholars knew that the Shahpur inscription of Aditysena was dated in the Sri Harsha era 66. According to Alberuni, the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE. Thus, Shahpur inscription was engraved around 391 BCE and therefore, the so-called later Gupta kings were actually the early Gupta kings. Western historians distorted the statement of Alberuni to establish the fictitious epoch of the Sri Harsha era in 606 CE. We will discuss the Sri Harsha era in detail in",

    "content": ". According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, the Gupta dynasty ruled for 245 years (BhokÈyanti dve œate paðca-catvÀriÚœacca vai samÀÍ). The last\n157 Gupta inscription (Damodarpur grant of ViÈõugupta) is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 224. Jinasena’s HarivaÚœa PurÀõa48 tells us that the Guptas ruled for 231 years whereas Jinabhadra KœamÀœramaõa refers to the duration of the Gupta rule as 255 years. Thus, the 245 years duration of the Gupta rule seems to be more accurate. The chronology of the Gupta Dynasty: Duration Gupta In CE Samvat (335 BCE) Œrigupta — — GhaÇotkachagupta — — Chandragupta I 7 years 0-4 338-331 BCE Samudragupta 51 years 5-55 331-280 BCE RÀmagupta 2 years? 56-57? 279-278 BCE Chandragupta II 36 years 57-93 278-242 BCE KumÀragupta I 42 years 94-136 241-199 BCE Skandagupta 23 years 136-158 199-177 BCE Purugupta Budhagupta NarasiÚhagupta BÀlÀditya 40 years 159-199 176-136 BCE KumÀragupta II and ViÈõugupta 44 years 200-243 136-92 BCE Total duration of the Gupta Rule was 245 years. The VÀkÀtaka Dynasty The VÀkÀtaka dynasty was one of the greatest royal dynasties of Central and South India. This dynasty flourished around the 4th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. Their Kingdom once extended from VidiœÀ (MÀlava) and Gujarat in the north to the Tungabhadra in the south and from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east. Vindhyaœakti of ViÈõuvÃddha gotra was the founder of VÀkÀtaka dynasty. The AmarÀvati (Guntur) pillar inscription49 mentions a certain GÃhapati VÀkÀtaka “Gahapatisa VÀkÀtakasa” who had gone to AmarÀvati with his wives to make donations which indicates the south-Indian origin of VÀkÀtaka dynasty. Unfortunately, all the inscriptions of VÀkÀtakas are dated only in regnal years. The chronology of the VÀkÀtakas can be THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n158 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA reconstructed based on the Poona plates50 of PrabhÀvati Gupta, the queen of VÀkÀtaka king Rudrasena II. PrabhÀvati Gupta was the daughter of the Gupta king Chandragupta II (278-242 BCE). Therefore, Vindhyaœakti must have ruled at least 100 years before this matrimonial alliance between the Guptas and VÀkÀtakas, placing his period of reign around 385-365 BCE. Pravarasena I, the son of Vindhyaœakti, succeeded him and consolidated the VÀkÀtaka kingdom taking advantage of the decline of the ŒÀtavÀhana Empire. According to PurÀõas,51 Pravarasena I ruled for 60 years (365-305 BCE) [VindhyaœaktisutaœcÀpi Praviro nÀma vÁryavÀn | BhokÈyate ca samÀ ØaÈÇi purÁm kÀncanakÀ ca vai || ]. Interestingly, the coins of Pravarasena I were found only in the Mathura region and not in the VÀkÀtaka kingdom. PurÁka city in Vidarbha was the earliest capital of the VÀkÀtakas. Pravarasena I had four sons but only two names Gautamiputra and Sarvasena are known to us. Gautamiputra’s son Rudrasena I succeeded his grandfather Pravarasena I whereas Sarvasena also became king and founded the Vatsagulma (Basim) branch of the VÀkÀtakas. According to the VÀkÀtaka genealogy given in inscriptions, King BhavanÀga of BhÀraœiva dynasty was the maternal grandfather of Rudrasena I who was ruling at PadmÀvati near Gwalior. King BhavanÀga’s successor was NÀgasena who was defeated by Samudragupta. It appears that Rudrasena I established his authority in the VÀkÀtaka succession struggle with the help of his maternal grandfather despite his three uncles. Thus, Rudrasena I became the successor of the main branch of the VÀkÀtakas and ruled for 25 years (305-280 BCE). He was succeeded by his son Prithvisena I. Chandragupta II was engaged in regular conflict with Western Œaka kœatraps. It seems that Prithvisena I supported Chandragupta II in his expedition leading to the conquest of SaurÀÈÇra. Thus, VÀkÀtakas became the allies of the Guptas and Chandragupta II married off his daughter, PrabhÀvatigupta to VÀkÀtaka YuvarÀja Rudrasena II around 265 BCE. Prithvisena I may have ruled for 30 years (280-250 BCE). His son Rudrasena II ascended the throne but unfortunately died after completing five regnal years (250-245 BCE). The Mandhal grant52 of Rudrasena II is dated in his 5th regnal year.\n159 Rudrasena II had three sons, DivÀkarasena, DÀmodarasena and Pravarasena II. PrabhÀvatigupta had to act as regent to her minor son YuvarÀja DivÀkarasena after the death of her husband. It is quite likely that she had the full support of her father Chandragupta II and brother KumÀragupta I to effectively administer the VÀkÀtaka kingdom. The Poona plates of PrabhÀvatigupta are dated in her 13th regnal year. DivÀkarasena may have died soon after her 13th regnal year and she continued to be regent for her younger son DÀmodarasena for a few more years. Thus, she ruled for 15 years (245-230 BCE). Probably, DÀmodarasena’s period of rule was between 230 BCE and 210 BCE. Thereafter, PrabhÀvtigupta’s youngest son, Pravarasena II ascended the throne around 210 BCE. It appears that Pravarasena II’s great-grandfather Rudrasena I or grandfather Prithvisena I may have shifted the VÀkÀtaka capital from Purika to Nandivardhana (NÀgardhan) near RÀmagiri or RÀmtek, Nagpur. KÀlidÀsa’s MeghadÂtam also mentions RÀmagiri (RÀmagiryÀœrameÈu). The Poona plates of PrabhÀvatigupta were issued from Nandivardhana. Pravarasena II shifted his capital from Nandivardhana to Pravarapura (Probably, Pavanar in Wardha district) prior to his 18th regnal year. The Chammak grant53 of Pravarasena II was issued from Pravarapura in his 18th regnal year. From the more than 16 copper plate inscriptions of Pravarasena II that have been discovered so far, it is clear that the reign of Pravarasena II was generally peaceful and prosperous. Undoubtedly, Pravarasena II ruled for at least 30 years (210-180 BCE). The Pandhurna grant54 of Pravarasena II was issued in his 29th regnal year. He also married his son Narendrasena to AjjhitabhaÇÇÀrikÀ, a daughter of Kuntala king, probably, the Kadamba king SiÚhavarman II (205-182 BCE). Interestingly, the Riddhapur plates55 dated in the 19th regnal year (201 BCE) of Pravarasena II describe PrabhÀvatigupta as “SÀgra-varÈa- œata-jÁva-putra-pautrÀ” which clearly tells us that PrabhÀvatigupta was in her 101st year amidst her sons and grandsons. It is evident that the Riddhapur plates were issued on the occasion of the completion of the 100th birth year of PrabhÀvatigupta. Dr. RC Majumdar once rightly argued that PrabhÀvatigupta was already more than a 100 years old by THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n160 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the time of the 19th regnal year of Pravarasena II but Dr. VV Mirashi distorted the fact by claiming that the expression referred to the long life blessing for her sons and grandsons.56 Undoubtedly, the expression “SÀgra-varÈa-œata-jÁva-putra-pautrÀ Œri MahÀdevi-PrabhÀvatigupta” tell us that she lived more than 100 years. Therefore, PrabhÀvatigupta must have born around 291 BCE and married Rudrasena II around 265 BCE. Dr. Mirashi also distorted the meaning of the expression “VÀkÀtakÀnÀm MahÀrÀja-DÀmodarasena-Pravarasena-jananÁ” and argued that DÀmodarasena and Pravarasena II were identical and DÀmodarasena assumed the coronation name of Pravarasena II but he could not provide any evidence. Dr. VV Mirashi and other historians have distorted these facts to establish that KÀlidÀsa was still alive during the initial years of Pravarasena II’s accession. Pravarasena II was also a learned person. He wrote the famous “Setubandha”, a KÀvya glorifying Rama in the Prakrit language. He also composed several Prakrit GÀthÀs which have been included in the GÀthÀsaptaœatÁ. According to RÀmadÀsa the commentator of the Setubandha, the same kÀvya was revised or re- composed in Sanskrit by KÀlidÀsa in obedience to the order of king VikramÀditya (MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja VikramÀdityenÀjðapto nikhila-kavi-cakra- cÂçÀmaõiÍ KÀlidÀsa-mahÀœayaÍ Setubandha-prabandham cikÁrÈur.....). Indian historians blindly believed in the concocted theory of Western historians that Chandragupta II was the VikramÀditya and KÀlidÀsa was in his court. Since PrabhÀvatigupta attained 100 years of age in the 19th regnal year of her youngest son, she ought to have been 81 years old when Pravarasena II ascended the throne but undoubtedly, Chandragupta II died at least a few years before his accession. KÀlidÀsa, who referred to himself as “nÃpasakhÀ” means the same age group friend of VikramÀditya, may have also died by then. Therefore, it would have been impossible for Chandragupta II to order KÀlidÀsa to re-compose the work of Pravarasena II. It is well known from Indian literary sources that KÀlidÀsa was in the court of Ujjain king VikramÀditya and not the PÀtalÁputra king Chandragupta II and lived in the 1st century BCE. Chandragupta II ruled around 278-242 BCE and Pravarasena II ruled around 210-180 BCE. As discussed in",

    "content": ", KÀlidÀsa lived around 105-25 BCE. Therefore,\n161 Pravarasena II wrote “Setubandha” at least 100 years before the birth of KÀlidÀsa. Setubandha became very popular among the scholars during the 2nd century BCE. Considering the popularity of Setubandha, the Ujjain king VikramÀditya might have requested KÀlidÀsa to re-compose it in Sanskrit in the 1st century BCE. Interestingly, some corrupt scholars even doubted Pravarasena II’s authorship of Setubandha on the ground that while the theme of the kÀvya is VaiÈõava, the king was a devotee of Œiva. Since RÀma was himself a devotee of Œiva, therefore this ridiculous argument is not tenable. Pravarasena II was succeeded by his son Narendrasena. He, probably, ruled for 20 years (180-160 BCE) but faced an invasion by the Nala king Bhavadattavarman in his initial years. The Nala dynasty was ruling in South Kosala (Chattisgarh). Narendrasena lost his kingdom up to Nandivardhana. It seems that he was forced to shift his capital from Pravarapura to Padmapura (in BhandÀrÀ district of Maharashtra). Padmapura was also the city of the ancestors of the famous Sanskrit poet BhavabhÂti. After the death of Bhavadattavarman, Narendrasena not only recaptured his kingdom but also subjugated the kings of Kosala, Mekala and MÀlava as stated in the BÀlÀghat plates.57 PrithvÁsena II succeeded his father Narendrasena as the last of the VÀkÀtaka kings; he ruled for 10 years (160 BCE-150 BCE) and with him, the rule of the VÀkÀtakas ended by 150 BCE. The chronology of the main branch of VÀkÀtakas: In CE 1. Vindhyaœakti 385-365 BCE 2. Pravarasena I 365-305 BCE 3. Rudrasena I 305-280 BCE 4. PÃithvisena I 280-250 BCE 5. Rudrasena II 250-245 BCE 6.

PÃithvisena II 160-150 BCE THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n162 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The ViÈõukunçin Dynasty The ViÈõukunçin dynasty was ruling in the °ndhra region during the reign of VÀkÀtakas. According to the Chikkulla, Tummalagudem and Tundi copper plate inscriptions58 of ViÈõukunçin king Vikramendravarman II, MÀdhavavarman II’s son Vikramendravarman I belonged to both the ViÈõukunçin and VÀkÀtaka dynasties (ViÈõukunçi- VÀkÀtaka-vaÚœa-dvayÀlankÃta-janmanaÍ). This means the ViÈõukunçin king MÀdhavavarman II married a VÀkÀtaka princess, probably, the\n163 THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA daughter of Pravarasena II. Some historians speculated that MÀdhavavarman II might have defeated the VÀkÀtakas but it is just a myth. VÀkÀtakas were more powerful than ViÈõukunçins. The IndrapÀlanagara (in Nalgonda district) inscription59 of Vikramendravarman II is dated in Saka 488 (95 BCE) and also in his 22nd regnal year. ViÈõukunçin kings were the successors of ŒÀlaôkÀyana kings and ruled in the °ndhra region. Based on the date given in IndrapÀlanagara inscription, the chronology of the ViÈõukunçin dynasty can be reconstructed as given below. Saka era In CE (583 BCE) 1. Indravarman 283-318 300-265 BCE 2. MÀdhavavarman I 318-348 265-235 BCE 3. Govindavarman I 348-378 235-205 BCE 4. MÀdhavavarman II 378-408 205-175 BCE 5. Vikramendravarman I 408-438 175-145 BCE 6. IndrabhaÇÇÀrakavarman 438-466 145-117 BCE 7. Vikramendravarman II or VikramendrabhaÇÇÀrakavarman 467-488 116-95 BCE The Vatsagulma Branch of VÀkÀtakas Sarvasena, the son of Pravarasena I was the founder the Vatsagulma branch of the VÀkÀtakas. His capital was Vatsagulma city, modern Basim in the Akola district of Maharashtra. VatsyÀyana’s KÀmasÂtra also mentions the city of Vatsagulma and the JayamaôgalÀ commentary on KÀmasÂtra tells us that Vatsa and Gulma were two princes of DakœiõÀpatha and the province led by them came to be known as Vatsagulma. Interestingly, GuõÀçhya mentioned in his BÃhatkathÀ that Vatsa and Gulma were his maternal uncles. Vatsagulma was well known as a centre of learning and culture. Some Ajanta caves of a later period were made during the rule of the Vatsagulma branch of the VÀkÀtakas. The Ajanta caves were made around the 8th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The earliest group of caves were made under the patronage of the ŒÀtavÀhanas and a later group of caves were made under the patronage of HariÈena, the last VÀkÀtaka king of Vatsagulma branch.\n164 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Sarvasena was a learned king and the author of the Prakrit kÀvya “Harivijaya”. He also authored many Prakrit GÀthÀs, some of which have been included in the GÀthÀsaptaœatÁ. Sarvasena’s son Vindhyaœakti ruled for a long period at least for 40 years. The Basim plates60 of Vindhyaœakti II were issued in his 37th regnal year. It appears that Vindhyaœakti II’s successor Pravarasena II may have ruled for a very short period. According to the Ajanta cave XVI inscription,61 Pravarasena II’ son ascended the throne when he was just 8 years old. Therefore he may have ruled for 50 years. His son Devasena became the king by 210 BCE because his Hisse-Borala inscription62 is dated in Saka 380 (203 BCE). This inscription clearly refers to the Œaka era (583 BCE) as “SakÀnÀm 380” and not ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 BCE). HariÈeõa succeeded his father Devasena as the last king of VÀkÀtakas of Vatsagulma branch. In CE Vindhyaœakti 385-365 BCE Pravarasena I 365-305 BCE 1. Sarvasena 340-305 BCE 2. Vindhyaœakti II or Vindhyasena 305-265 BCE 3. Pravarasena II 265-260 BCE 4. The son of Pravarasena II (name not known) 260-210 BCE 5. Devasena or DevarÀja 210-180 BCE 6. HariÈeõa 180-150 BCE The feudatories of the Guptas (Maitrakas, ParivrÀjakas, Ucchakalpas, GÀrulakas and Saidhavas) The Maitrakas were the feudatories of the Gupta kings and used Gupta SaÚvat in their inscriptions. BhaÇÀrka was the founder of this dynasty. BhaÇÀrka and his elder son Dharasena I were the SenÀpatis or commanders of the Gupta army in SaurÀÈÇra during the reign of Skandagupta and NarasiÚhagupta BÀlÀditya. Maitrakas established the city of Valabhi as their capital. BhaÇÀrka’s second son DroõasiÚha called himself “MahÀrÀja” and used the term “ParamabhaÇÇÀraka-pÀdÀnudhyÀta” in his Bhamodra Mahota inscription63 dated in Gupta SaÚvat 183 (153- 152 BCE). It seems that Dronasimha achieved the status of a feudatory\n165 king of the Guptas during the reign of NarasiÚhagupta BÀlÀditya by 153 BCE. DroõasiÚha’s younger brother Dhruvasena I succeeded him. Guhasena ruled between Gupta SaÚvat 235 to 252. The Gupta Empire declined by Gupta SaÚvat 243 (92 BCE). Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Gupta Empire, Guhasena became a sovereign ruler. SÁlÀditya VII was the last ruler of Valabhi. The Alina grant64 of SÁlÀditya VII is dated in Gupta SaÚvat 447 (112 CE). More than 70 inscriptions of Maitrakas are available, based on which the chronology of Maitrakas can be reconstructed: Gupta SaÚvat (335 BCE) In CE BhaÇÀrka 140-150 195-185 BCE Dharasena I 150-170 185-165 BCE DroõasiÚha 170-185 165-150 BCE Dhruvasena I 185 -226 150-109 BCE DharapaÇÇa 227-235 108-100 BCE Guhasena 235-251 100-84 BCE Dharasena II 252-275 83-60 BCE SÁlÀditya I (DharmÀditya) 275-295 60-40 BCE Kharagraha I 295-300 40-35 BCE Dharasena III 300-312 35-23 BCE Dhruvasena II (BÀlÀditya) 312-323 23-12 BCE Dharasena IV 323-333 12-2 BCE Dhruvasena III 333-337 2 BCE-2 CE Kharagraha II 337-340 2-5 CE SÁlÀditya II 340-347 5-12 CE SÁlÀditya III 347-381 12-46 CE SÁlÀditya IV 381-390 46-55 CE SÁlÀditya V 390-415 55-80 CE SÁlÀditya VI 415-442 80-107 CE A grant65 of Valabhi dated in ŒÀlivÀhana (Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta) 400 (478 CE) tells us that MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja Parameœvara ParamabhaÇÇÀraka Dharasenadeva was ruling in Valabhi. He was the son of Guhasena II and the grandson of BhaÇÇÀrka II. It seems that BhaÇÇÀrka II re-established THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n166 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the rule of Maitrakas in the beginning of the 5th century. Thus, BhaÇÇÀrka II ruled around 400-430 CE and Guhasena II ruled around 430-460 CE. This grant is also evidence to prove that the Gupta era commenced much earlier than 319-320 CE. Interestingly, this grant tells us that Guhasena II was proficient in three languages i.e. Sanskrit, Prakrit and ApabhraÚœa. ŒÀlivÀhana In CE era (78 CE) BhaÇÇÀrka 322-352 400-430 CE Guhasena II 352-382 430-460 CE Dharasenadeva or Dharasena V 382-400 460-478 CE Interestingly, Buhler declared this Valabhi grant a forgery one by erroneously identifying Dharasenadeva with Dharasena II; this is clear because if one considers the epoch of the Gupta era in 319 CE, it is impossible to fix the date of Guhasena’s son Dharasena II around 478 CE. The inscriptions of Guhasena and Dharasena II are dated between Gupta SaÚvat 240 and 270. Actually, this erroneous identification of Dharasenadeva could have been avoided if he had accepted the epoch of the Gupta era in the 4th century BCE instead of the 4th century CE. In fact, the blind belief of Western historians in the contemporaneity of Chandragupta Maurya and Alexander not only led to numerous distortions and concoctions in the chronology of ancient India but also created the myth of the existence of forged inscriptions. Truly speaking, the distorted chronology of the Gupta dynasty and the Maitrakas given by Western historians and their followers is a forgery and not the cited Valabhi grant. Buhler concocted that the Valabhi grant is a forgery because the seal of the grant and the genealogy given are different from other Valabhi grants. There is a gap of 266 years between the last grant of SÁlÀditya VII [Gupta SaÚvat 447 (112 CE)] and the Valabhi grant of Dharasenadeva [ŒÀlivÀhana 400 (478 CE)]. Dharasenadeva was the grandson of BhaÇÇÀrka whereas Dharasena II was the grandson of DharapaÇÇa. Moreover, Dharasena II never used the title “Deva”— attached to the names of later Valabhi kings from the Grants of SÁlÀditya III to SÁlÀditya VII. Thus,\n167 Dharasenadeva cannot be identified as Dharasena II, the son of Guhasena I but undoubtedly, a later Valabhi king and the son of Guhasena II who ruled in the 5th century CE, 250 years after SÁlÀditya VII. Therefore, the seal and the genealogy of Dharasenadeva are different from those of Dharasena II. Buhler also argued that the Valabhi grant is written in Gurjara characters and closely resembles those of Umeta, Bagumra and Ilao plates of Gurjara ruler Dadda II PraœÀntarÀga of BharukaccÍa (Bharoch). Historians again wrongly identified the Dadda of Umeta, Bagumra and Ilao grants to be Dadda II. The Kaira grants of Dadda II are dated in the Kalachuri-Chedi era from the year 380 to 392 and two more grants of Dadda II are dated in the year 427 of the Kalachuri-Chedi era. It may be noted that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403-402 BCE. Thus, Dadda I and Dadda II flourished in the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE respectively whereas Dadda of Umeta, Bagumra and Ilao grants lived in 5th century CE. Therefore, he must be identified as Dadda IV. Interestingly, Dharasenadeva’s Valabhi grant and Umeta grant of Dadda IV PraœÀntarÀga were issued on the same date i.e. 3rd April 478 CE (full moon day of VaiœÀkha month in ŒÀlivÀhana 400). Valabhi grant and Ilao grant both were written by Reva, the son of MÀdhava. Actually, Dadda IV PraœÀntarÀga was a feudatory of the Valabhi king Dharasenadeva as inscribed on the seals “Œri-SÀmanta-Dadda”. Thus, these grants not only closely resemble each other but are also almost exact copies of the same text. Therefore, the Valabhi grant of Dharasenadeva is genuine. Interestingly, JF Fleet has rejected the Umeta, Bagumra and Ilao plates of Dadda IV PraœÀntarÀga due to some other complications in his distorted chronology. We will discuss this issue in the context of Kalachuri-Chedi era in",

The chronology of the kings of ParivrÀjakas and Ucchakalpas can be reconstructed based on the Gupta era mentioned in their inscriptions. THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n168 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Gupta SaÚvat In CE (335 BCE) The ParivrÀjakas DevÀdhya — — Prabhaðjana — — DÀmodara — — HÀstin 156-198 179-137 BCE SaÚkœobha 199-210 136-125 BCE The Ucchakalpas Aughadeva — — KumÀradeva — — JayasvÀmi — — VyÀghra — — Jayanta 174-190 161-145 BCE SarvanÀtha 191-215 146-120 BCE It is quite likely that the GÀrulaka kings were also feudatories of the Guptas or the Maitrakas because they used Gupta SaÚvat in their inscriptions. VarÀhadÀsa I was the founder of the GÀrulaka family. It seems that he was a SenÀpati. According to the PalitÀna plates,66 his son VarÀhadÀsa II and grandson SiÚhÀditya ruled in Gupta SaÚvat 230 to 255. Gupta SaÚvat In CE (335 BCE) VarÀhadÀsa I — — VarÀhadÀsa II 105 BCE SiÚhÀditya 80 BCE The Saindhavas of Saurashtra were the contemporary kings of the Maitrakas in Gujarat. Probably, they were also feudatories of the Gupta Kings because they used Gupta SaÚvat in their inscriptions. Saindhavas were ruling from the ancient city of BhÂtÀmbilika or Bhumilika (Ghumli) in Western KÀÇhiÀwÀr. They claimed that Jayadratha of the MahÀbhÀrata era was the founder of their family. Jayadratha was the son-in-law of DhÃtarÀÈÇra and the ruler of Sindhu-deœa. The name of Saindhava has been derived from the word Sindhu. Six copper plate inscriptions of the\n169 Saindhavas67 were found at Ghumli and dated in Gupta SaÚvat 513 to 596. One more grant68 of Jaika II was found in Morbi and dated in Gupta SaÚvat 585. One undated grant69 found in Prabhaspatan (in Junagarh) was issued by a Saindhava king Ahivarman. According to the genealogy given in the grants of Jaika II, PuÈyadeva was the founder of the Saindhava kingdom. The name of MahÀrÀja MahÀsenÀpati PuÈya, the son of Ahivarman is mentioned on the clay seal found at Valabhi. The NavasÀri Plates70 of Chalukya king AvanijanÀœraya PulakeœirÀja dated in Kalachuri-Chedi era 490 (87 CE) mentions the kingdom of Saindhavas. Probably, PuÈyadeva or KrishnarÀja I was the contemporary of the Chalukya king PulakeœirÀja. The chronology of the kings of Saindhava family can be reconstructed based on the date mentioned in the Gupta era in their inscriptions. Gupta SaÚvat In CE (335 BCE) Ahivarman -- -- PuÈyadeva 400-420 65-85 CE KrishnarÀja I 420-440 85-105 CE Agguka I 440-460 105-125 CE Raõaka 460-480 125-145 CE KrishnarÀja II 480-500 145-165 CE Agguka II 500-525 165-190 CE Jaika I 525-556 190-221 CE ChÀmunçarÀja 556-565 221-230 CE Agguka III 565-580 230-245 CE Jaika II 580-600 245-265 CE All the grants of the Saindhava kings refer to them as “MahÀsÀmanta” meaning feudatories. The Dhiniki grant of King Jaikadeva71 dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 794 (737 CE) refers to him as “SaurÀÈÇramançalÀdhipatiÍ ParamabhaÇÇÀraka-MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja- ParameœvaraÍ” denoting that he was an independent ruler. Dr. AS Altekar rejected the Dhiniki grant as a forgery because all Saindhava rulers were feudatories and the name of Jaikadeva is not THE EPOCH OF THE GUPTA ERA\n170 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA mentioned in the genealogy given by Jaika II. Actually, the problem is again with the epoch of the Gupta era. Considering the epoch of the Gupta era in 319-320 CE, Dr. Altekar believed that Jaika II ruled around 899-919 CE. Thus, Jaikadeva flourished as a sovereign king at least 160 years earlier but Jaika II did not give the name of Jaikadeva, the only sovereign Saindhava ruler in his genealogy consisting of seven generations. Therefore, he declared the Dhiniki grant of Jaikadeva a forgery. Dr. Altekar also argued that the date of the grant is also spurious due to non-occurrence of the eclipse on the date given. As explained in the beginning of this chapter, the Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE and not in 319 CE. Thus, Jaika II flourished in the 3rd century CE whereas Jaikadeva flourished in the 8th century CE. Therefore, the Dhiniki grant is absolutely genuine. It is likely that Narahari, the chief of accounts department (MahÀkœapÀÇalika) and the writer of this grant, made a mistake in calculating the year in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. He probably under calculated 10 years while converting the ŒÀlivÀhana era or other era into Vikrama era. He calculated 794 instead of 804. Thus, the correct date of the Dhiniki grant must be ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 804 (747 CE). The date regularly corresponds to 7th November 747 CE. The solar eclipse was visible in SaurÀÈÇra on new moon day of the KÀrttika Month and the nakœatra was JyeÈÇha. \u0002\n171 Most of the north Indian inscriptions used the Vikrama era and referred to the era as “KÃta”, “MÀlava-gaõa” and “Vikrama”. Many inscriptions simply referred to the era as “SaÚvat” without mentioning the name of the era. One Mandasor inscription1 tells us that “KÃta” and “MÀlava-gaõa” refer to the same era (Œri-MÀlava-gaõÀmnÀte praœaste KÃta- saÚjðite). The study of these inscriptions also indicates that the KÃta era or MÀlava-gaõa era was also referred to as the Vikrama era in a later period. Thus, all historians were in general agreement that the KÃta era, MÀlava-gaõa era and Vikrama era refer to the same epoch. However, opinions differ on the origin and originator of the KÃta era, MÀlava-gaõa era or the Vikrama era. There are two theories about the origin of Vikrama era. 1. The KÃta era, MÀlava-gaõa era or Vikrama era commenced from the same epoch i.e. 57 BCE. 2. According to Kota Venkatachalam,2 the KÃta era or MÀlava-gaõa era commenced in 725 BCE whereas Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. The issue of the originator of the Vikrama era is also one of the most controversial problems of ancient Indian history and again there are two prime theories relating to this issue: 1. Indian literary and archaeological sources are unanimous in declaring King VikramÀditya of Ujjain, the originator of the Vikrama era. 2. Western historians and their followers propounded that the Scythian king Azes I or the Parthian king Vonones initiated this era in North-Western India from where it was later brought to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh by the MÀlava people.",

    "content": "The Epoch of the KÃta, MÀlava-gaõa and Vikrama era\n172 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA John Marshall was the first to suggest that the MahÀrÀja Aya mentioned in the TakœaœilÀ silver scroll inscription3 dated in the year 136 and the MahÀrÀja Aja mentioned in the Kalwan copper-plate inscription4 dated in the year 134 were one and the same and that it was the era used in the inscriptions of the Scythian king Azes I was the actual so-called Vikrama era. BN Mukharjee has also cited five more inscriptions5 of MahÀrÀja Aya dated in the years from 63 to 126 and strongly propagated the theory that the era used in MahÀrÀja Aya’s inscriptions is actually the Azes era which was later known as the Vikrama era. He also opined that the Azes era came into use out of the continuation of counting the regnal years of king Azes even after his death. DC Sircar suggested that the Parthian king Vonones had initiated this era in the first century BCE. DR Bhandarkar stated that it was probably PuÈyamitra Œuôga who initiated this era. VV Mirashi speculated that the Vikrama era was founded by the MÀlava people in commemoration of their victory over the Œakas and that it was later named after VikramÀditya Chandragupta II. Indian literary and archaeological sources, however, tell us that it was VikramÀditya who founded this era. But the racial bias towards Indian literary sources nurtured by Western historians and their followers led us to these baseless speculations. Actually, the distorted chronology of ancient India as presented by such historians cannot prove the existence of King VikramÀditya in the 1st century BCE. Therefore, eminent historians generally believed that King VikramÀditya was purely a mythical figure. Surprisingly, some historians ignorant of the ancient glorious Indian astronomical tradition even speculated that the ancient Indians were not accustomed to the use of eras and that such earlier eras like Kaliyuga, YudhiÈÇhira, Buddha-nirvÀõa or Mahavira- nirvÀõa were just fictitious inventions of a later age. Thus, the Vikrama era and the Œaka era were supposedly ‘founded’ originally by foreign rulers. There being compelling evidence that ancient India was indeed the birth place of astronomy and that the knowledge of astronomy was disseminated to the rest of the world from India, it would be absurd and nonsensical to think that ancient Indians were not accustomed to the use of eras; it is demonstrable that Indians were the first to use eras\n173 such as SaptarÈi era, Kaliyuga era, etc. in the history of human civilisation. There is enough numismatic and literary evidence to prove that VikramÀditya was the real king of MÀlava and not a mythical figure. As a matter of fact, there were two VikramÀdityas who ruled over MÀlava. VikramÀditya I reigned in the MÀlava kingdom around 719-718 BCE and founded the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era whereas VikramÀditya II ruled over MÀlava around 57 BCE and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era was named after him. I have not considered Chandragupta II (278-242 BCE) as VikramÀditya because Indian literary or archaeological sources refer to Chandragupta II as “Chandragupta-VikramÀditya” but never independently as “VikramÀditya”. All the Gupta kings had regnal names but they never used them independently in their inscriptions. Gupta inscriptions refer to him as Chandragupta whereas VÀkÀtaka inscriptions refer to him as Devagupta. Some of the coins of Chandragupta II have the legend “Chandragupta-VikramÀditya”. It is evident that Chandragupta II was generally not referred to as VikramÀditya. Therefore, the coins found with the legends “Œri VikramaÍ”, “VikramÀdityah”, “Kœitimavajitya sucharitairdivam jayati VikramÀdityaÍ”,6 etc. must belong to either VikramÀditya I or VikramÀditya II but historians mistakenly identified the VikramÀditya of these coins with Chandragupta II. The epoch of the Mahavira-nirvÀõa era Jaina PaÇÇÀvalis are the historical records of Jainas and provide great deal of information about the early history of Jainas. These PaÇÇÀvalis used the Mahavira-nirvÀõa era and tell us about the king VikramÀditya who founded the KÀrttikÀdi era in 719-718 BCE.

    "content": ". Therefore, the Œaka era started exactly after an interval of 135 years from the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. Primarily, we have to fix the date of Mahavira-nirvÀõa to reconstruct the early history of the Jainas based on the valuable information available in the ancient Jaina literary sources. 1. According to Kharatara-gaccÍa and Tapa-gaccÍa,7 two main sects of Jaina PaÇÇÀvalis, King VikramÀditya received “dÁkœÀ” of Jainism from the Jaina scholar Siddhasena DivÀkara in Mahavira- nirvÀõa saÚvat 470. Thus, Mahavira attained nirvÀõa 470 years before 719-718 BCE. THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n174 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 2. Jaina works like Tiloyapannati of YativÃÈabha, HarivaÚœa of Jinasena, Dhavala of °chÀrya VÁrasena, TrilokasÀra of Nemichandra, Mahaviracaritam of Nemichandra and VicÀraœreõi of Merutuôga tell us that Mahavira attained nirvÀõa 605 years and 5 months before the start of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and 470 years before the start of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). 3. Jaina works like PaÇÇÀvalis of Nandi, Sena and KÀÈÇhÀ saÚghas, Tiloyapannati, JambÂdvÁpa-prajðapti SaÚgraha, HarivaÚœa, Dhavala, Jayadhavala, KalpasÂtra, TherÀvali, PariœiÈÇaparva and PrabhÀvakacaritam give the genealogy of the 28 immediate successors of Mahavira up to 683 years from Mahavira-nirvÀõa. These Jaina works also state that by deducting 77 years and 7 months from the period of 683 years, we get 605 years and 5 months, which is the exact interval between Mahavira-nirvÀõa and the beginning of the Œaka era (583 BCE). According to Guõabhadra’s UttarapurÀõa, Mahavira became a Siddha in the month of KÀrttika, kÃÈõa pakœa chaturdaœi and SvÀti nakœatra. Thus, Mahavira attained nirvÀõa on 22nd October 1189-88 BCE, 605 years and 5 months before the commencement of the Œaka era in 583 BCE. Gradually, during the early medieval period, Indians forgot the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and it appears that only the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) gained popularity during the 11th century CE when Alberuni visited India. Since the Œaka era and the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era were generally not in vogue, Alberuni could only collect the information of the epoch of the ŒÀlivÀhana era and the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. Therefore, eminent historians also could not distinguish between the epochs of the Œaka & the ŒÀlivÀhana eras and the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama & the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama eras. Thus, some historians erroneously believed the year of Mahavira-nirvÀõa to be 527 BCE on the presumption that the Œaka & the ŒÀlivÀhana eras commenced in 78 CE and the KÀrttikÀdi & ChaitrÀdi Vikrama eras commenced in 57 BCE. Some historians argued that Mahavira’s nirvÀõa occurred in 467 BCE based on the statement of the Jaina author Hemachandra (5th century\n175 CE). The PariœiÈÇaparva of Hemachandra tells us that Chandragupta ascended the throne at Ujjain in the Mahavira-nirvÀõa era 155. “Evam ca Œri-Mahavira-mukter-varÈa-œate gate | Paðca-paðcÀœadadhike Chandragupto’bhavannÃpaÍ || ” Apart from Hemachandra’s work, Sanskrit works like BÃhatkathÀkoœa of HariÈeõa, BhadrabÀhucaritam of Ratnanandi and Kannada works like MunivaÚœÀbhyudaya of ChidÀnandakavi, RÀjÀvalikathe of Devachandra (1838 CE)9 also mention that Chandragupta, the king of Ujjain, became the disciple of BhadrabÀhu. Chandragiri, a cave associated with BhadrabÀhu and a few inscriptions at Œravaõabelgola in KarnÀÇaka also substantiate the visit of BhadrabÀhu to Œravaõabelgola along with his disciple Chandragupta. The brief story of BhadrabÀhu, the last Œrutakevalin runs thus: “BhadrabÀhu was the son of a BrÀhmaõa named Somaœarma who was in the court of King Padmaratha or Padmadhara of Devakotta city in Paunçravardhana (North Bengal) region. The fourth Œrutakevalin Govardhana met BhadrabÀhu when he was playing with his friends. He became BhadrabÀhu’s teacher later. Thus, BhadrabÀhu received “dÁkœÀ” of Jainism from Govardhana and became the fifth Œrutakevalin. In the course of his wanderings, BhadrabÀhu went to Ujjain and during his stay in Ujjain, Chandragupta or Chandragupti, the king of Ujjain received “dÁkœÀ” of Jainism from BhadrabÀhu. One day, Chandragupta requested BhadrabÀhu to interpret his dreams of the previous night. While explaining them, BhadrabÀhu predicted a twelve-year famine in the kingdom. Therefore, he advised his followers to leave Ujjain and go south. King Chandragupta handed over the reins of kingdom to his son SiÚhasena and followed his guru. Thus, BhadrabÀhu along with Chandragupta visited Œravaõabelgola and stayed at Chikka betta or Chandragiri where he died by the Jaina rite of Sallekhana or in an attack by a tiger. Chandragupta continued to stay at Chandragiri by worshipping god and died by the rite of Sallekhana. Sometime after the death of Chandragupta, his grandson BhÀskara, the son of SiÚhasena came to Œravaõabelgola and built Jain temples and a city near Chandragiri which was named Belgola.” It is evident, according to the ancient Jaina tradition, that Chandragupta or Chandragupti was the king of Ujjain and not THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n176 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA PÀtaliputra. He was the father of SiÚhasena and the grandfather of BhÀskara whereas Chandragupta Maurya was the father of BindusÀra and grandfather of Aœoka. Actually, Jain scholars like Hemachandra, ChidÀnandakavi, etc. of later period mistakenly identified Chandragupta, the disciple of BhadrabÀhu to be Chandragupta Maurya. Moreover, none of the early Jaina works mention Mauryan kings after Mahavira-nirvÀõa. Jaina PaÇÇÀvalis like Kharatara-gaccÍa and Tapa-gaccÍa mention BhadrabÀhu and his death in Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 170 (1019 BCE) but do not give any details of King Chandragupta. HarivaÚœa, written by JinasenasÂri in Œaka 705 (122 CE), gives the details of the duration of the rule of various kings starting from the NirvÀõa of Mahavira. According to HarivaÚœa, king PÀlaka ascended the throne in the year of Mahavira-nirvÀõa. It is also recorded in Jaina tradition that Chança Pradyota, the king of Avanti, died on the same night Mahavira attained nirvÀõa and was succeeded by his son PÀlaka. Starting from Mahavira-nirvÀõa year,10 \u0002 The PÀlaka kings ruled for 60 years \u0002 The Viœaya kings ruled for 150 years \u0002 The Muruôças ruled for 40 years \u0002 PuÈpamitra ruled for 30 years \u0002 Vasumitra and Agnimitra ruled for 60 years \u0002 The “RÀsabha” kings ruled for 100 years \u0002 NaravÀhana ruled for 40 years \u0002 The BhaÇÇubÀõas ruled for 240 years \u0002 The Gupta kings ruled for 231 years \u0002 KalkirÀja ruled for 42 years \u0002 After KalkirÀja, his son AjitaÚjaya began his rule at Indrapura. Therefore, it is clear that Jaina PaÇÇÀvalis and HarivaÚœa carry no mention of Maurya kings after Mahavira-nirvÀõa. According to the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, SaptarÈi or the Great Bear was in MaghÀ constellation during the time of Yudhishthira and it was in Œravaõa constellation during the rule of the Nanda dynasty.\n177 SaptarÈayo MaghÀyuktÀÍ kÀle YaudhiÈÇhire œatam | Œravaõe te bhaviÈyanti kÀle Nandasya bhÂpateÍ || 11 Since Œravaõa is the 15th star in the reverse direction from MaghÀ, the interval between the times of YudhiÈÇhira and Nanda was 1500 years.

Therefore, Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne 1600 years after YudhiÈÇhira (3128 BCE or 3109 BCE) and commenced his rule around 1516 BCE whereas Mahavira attained nirvÀõa in 1189-1188 BCE considering 605 years and 5 months before the commencement of the Œaka era (583 BCE). Mahavira attained nirvÀõa 327 years after the accession of Chandragupta Maurya. It is therefore logical not to find any mention of the Mauryas after Mahavira-nirvÀõa in either the, HarivaÚœa of JinasenasÂri or other early Jaina works. Later Jaina scholars like Hemachandra, ChidÀnandakavi, etc. mistakenly identified Chandragupta or Chandragupti, the king of Ujjain to be Chandragupta Maurya. Based on this mistaken identity, some historians believed that the Maurya kings had a second capital at Ujjain and that the accession of Chandragupta Maurya at Ujjain took place in 312 BCE. Therefore, they came to the mistaken conclusion that Mahavira died in 467 BCE. As seen above, Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne 327 years prior to Mahavira-nirvÀõa and therefore, Chandragupta, the disciple of BhadrabÀhu, cannot be identified with Chandragupta Maurya. It is quite probable that Chandragupta was the one of the earlier kings of the MÀlava Gupta dynasty (wrongly referred to as the later Guptas) who became the ruler of Ujjain 155 years after Mahavira-nirvÀõa. Moreover, while Hemachandra calculated the year of the accession of Chandragupta in Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 155, other sources such as the Tiloyapannati of YativÃÈabha (2nd century BCE), HarivaÚœa of JinasenasÂri (122 CE), TrilokasÀra of Nemichandra, VicÀraœreõi of Meruttuôga and many other Jaina works mention Mahavira-nirvÀõa SaÚvat 215 as the year that Chandragupta ascended the throne, clearly making it evident that Chandragupta, the disciple of BhadrabÀhu was the king of Ujjain and cannot be identified with Chandragupta Maurya. Mahavira attained nirvÀõa on 22nd October 1189-1188 BCE exactly 605 years and 5 months before the commencement of the Œaka era in Chaitra month of 583 BCE. THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n178 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era According to Jaina PaÇÇÀvalis, King Gardabhilla became the king of Ujjain in Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 453 (736-735 BCE) and reigned for 13 years. Early Jaina scholars have preserved an interesting historical story named “KÀlakÀcÀrya-kathÀnaka” in their works. This story tells us the background of the rise of VikramÀditya in 719-718 BCE. In the Jaina tradition, there were three KÀlakÀcÀryas.12 KÀlakÀcÀrya I lived around Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 376 (813-812 BCE) and authored commentaries on “Nigoças”. KÀlakÀcÀrya II lived during the reign of king Gardabhilla (736-723 BCE) whereas KÀlakÀcÀrya III flourished around Mahavira- nirvÀõa saÚvat 993 (196-195 BCE). The famous “KÀlakÀcÀrya-KathÀnaka” is the real story of KÀlakÀcÀrya II. “King VairisiÚha of DhÀrÀ (modern Dhar in Madhya Pradesh) had a son named KÀlaka and a daughter named Sarasvati, both of whom embraced Jainism at an early age. They went to Ujjain which was the major centre of Jainism in Madhyadeœa. King Gardabhilla, the king of Ujjain at that time was so smitten by Sarasvati’s beauty that he forcibly took her to his palace. All of KÀlaka’s efforts and pleas to convince the king to release his sister with honour went in vain. Furious and frustrated KÀlaka decided to avenge this humiliation. He went westward, crossed the Sindhu River and reached the country (modern Afghanistan) where a number of Œaka kœatraps were ruling as subordinate to the ŒÀhÀnuœÀhÁ kings. He successfully persuaded 95 or 96 Œaka kœatraps to migrate to India and become independent rulers instead of ruling as subordinates. These Œaka kœatraps came to Ujjain accompanied by KÀlaka and defeated the King Gardabhilla and imprisoned him. KÀlaka thus avenged his humiliation and liberated his sister Sarasvati. The Œaka kœatraps declared themselves the kings of Ujjain in Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 466 (723- 722 BCE) and had ruled for four years when VikramÀditya, the Great attacked the Œakas and drove them away. Thus, VikramÀditya became the king of Ujjain and founded the KÀrttikÀdi era in 719-718 BCE which was referred to initially as the KÃta era or MÀlava-gaõa era and later as the Vikrama era.”\n179 KÀlakÀcÀrya II, also known as KÀlakasÂri, is repeatedly mentioned as the uprooter of Gardabhilla in Jaina tradition. Apart from the PaÇÇÀvalis, KÀlakasÂri is mentioned in SthÀnakavÃtti, DharmopadeœamÀlÀvÃtti, PuÈpamÀlÀvÃtti, Samasta-KÀlakÀcÀrya-KathÀ and PrabhÀvakacaritam. According to Jaina works, the illustrious king VikramÀditya received “dÁkœÀ” of Jainism from Siddhasena DivÀkara in MahÀvria-nirvÀõa saÚvat 470 (719-718 BCE) and ruled for 60 years. After VikramÀditya, his four successors ruled for a period of 75 years and 5 months. Thus, the dynasty of VikramÀditya ruled for 135 years and 5 months. The Œaka kœatraps regrouped themselves and invaded Ujjain again after 135 years and 5 months and re-occupied Ujjain. It is quite probable that the Œaka MahÀkœatrapa CaÈÇana was coronated as the king of Ujjain. He founded the Œaka era in 583 BCE which was referred to as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀla”, “Œaka-nÃpa-rÀjyÀbhiÈeka-saÚvatsara”, etc. The chronology of King VikramÀditya and his four successors is given in the GurvÀvali of VÃddhagaccÍa: “Sunnamuniveyajutta 470 Jinakala Vikkamo varisa-satthi 60 | Dhammaichcho chalisa 40 Gaila panavisa 25 Nahade attha 8 | Ikkammi 3 vasasaye gayami panatisavachcharasadiye 135 | Vikkama-kalau saga na vachcharo puna vi samjao |”13 Mahavira-nirvÀõa SaÚvat (1189-1188 BCE) In CE 1. Gardabhilla (13 years) 453-466 736-723 BCE 2. Œaka Kœatrapas (4 years) 466-470 723-719 BCE 3. VikramÀditya (60 years) 470-530 719-659 BCE 4. 1st successor (40 years) 530-570 659-619 BCE 5. 2nd successor (25 years) 570-595 619-594 BCE 6. 3rd successor (8 years) 595-602 594-587 BCE 7. 4th successor (3years) 602-605 587-583 BCE 8. Coronation a Œaka king 605 (1st day of 19th February (Probably CaÈÇana) Chaitra month) 583 BCE It is evident from early Jaina sources that VikramÀditya founded an era in Mahavira-nirvÀõa saÚvat 470 (719-718 BCE) when he became the king of Ujjain by defeating the 96 Œakas. PrabhÀvakacarita of THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n180 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA PrabhÀvakasÂri mentions that KÀlakÀcÀrya brought 96 Œakas to Ujjain to uproot Gardabhilla. GathÀœaptaœati, a Prakrit anthology compiled by the ŒÀtavÀhana king HÀla of the 5th century BCE, tells us that VikramÀditya was an illustrious king well known for his generosity and victories (Samvahana-suha-rasa-tosiena demtena tuha kara lakkham | Chalanena Vikkamaiccha-chariam anusikkhiam tissa |). The BÃhatkathÀ of GuõÀçhya (5th century BCE) also has a record of VikramÀditya. The RÀjamahendravaram inscription14 of Vishnuvardhana dated in Kaliyuga era 2628 (475-474 BCE) refers to VikramÀditya while comparing Vishnuvardhana with VikramÀditya (VikramÀditya iva rÀjanya-viÈama- siddhiÍ). Subandhu (400-250 BCE), the author of VÀsavadattÀ, also pays tribute to the King VikramÀditya. The above cited literary sources refer to the great king VikramÀditya who defeated Œakas and founded an era in 719-718 BCE belong to the period prior to the 1st centrury BCE. The people of MÀlava who suffered considerably under the tyrannical four-year rule (723-719 BCE) of the Œakas were liberated when VikramÀditya led the MÀlava army and drove away the Œakas, thus elevating VikramÀditya to the status of a legend not only in MÀlava but over entire India as well. The people of MÀlava considered the rule of VikramÀditya as a golden era and they named the era founded by him as “KÃta” era. Since this era has commenced from the date of the establishment of MÀlava-gaõa or MÀlava republic, it was also referred to as the MÀlava-gaõa era. Interestingly, this era commenced on the 1st tithi of the bright fortnight (œukla pratipadÀ) of KÀrttika month in 719-718 BCE i.e. 17th September 719 BCE or 17th October 719 BCE. Undoubtedly, this KÃta or MÀlava-gaõa era is KÀrttikÀdi and its months are amÀnta. The NÀndsÀ (Udaypur, Rajasthan) Pillar inscription15 of Œaktiguõaguru is the earliest inscription dated in the KÃta era or KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 282 (437 BCE). Two yÂpa inscriptions16 from Barnala (Jaipur) are also dated in KÃta 284 (435 BCE) and KÃta 335 (384 BCE). The inscriptions of the Maukharis, Aulikaras, PratÁhÀras, ParamÀras, Chaulukyas, ChÀhamÀnas, GÀhadwÀlas and ChandrÀtreyas (Chandellas) used the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE).\n181 The Maukharis The Maukhari was one of the oldest Kœatriya dynasties of North India. Mukhara was the progenitor of the Maukharis. Later Sanskrit grammarians like VÀmana, JayÀditya and KaiyaÇa have mentioned “Maukharya” as an example of “gotrÀvayava”.17 This indicates that the Maukhari dynasty is derived from one of the ancient gotras. The Haraha inscription18 claims that the Maukharis are descendants of the hundred sons whom king Aœvapati got as a boon from Vaivasvata (Sutaœatam lebhe nÃpo’œvapatir VaivasatÀd.....) According to the MahÀbhÀrata, Aœvapati was a king of Madra in Central Punjab. Three Yupa inscriptions19 found in Kota, RÀjasthan are the earliest inscriptions of the Maukharis that are dated in the KÃta or KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama SaÚvat 295 (424-423 BCE). These YÂpas were installed by the three sons (Balavardhana, Somadeva and BalasiÚha) of MahÀ-SenÀpati Maukhari Bala on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month i.e. 26th January 423 BCE. The Barabar20 and Nagarjuni hill21 inscriptions tell us that The Maukharis were reigning in the GayÀ region of Magadha as chief feudatories (SÀmanta-cÂçÀmaõi). These inscriptions refer to one Maukhari chief Anantavarman, the son of ŒÀrdÂlavarman and the grandson of Yajðavarman. Unfortunately, these inscriptions are not dated. It is quite likely that Yajðavarman, ŒÀrdÂlavarman and Anantavarman ruled as feudatories of the ŒÀtavÀhanas in the 6th century BCE. Historians wrongly assumed that they were feudatories of the Imperial Guptas. According to the Harshacharita of BÀõabhaÇÇa, the Maukhari prince Grahavarman, the son of Avantivarman, married RÀjyaœrÁ, the daughter of PrabhÀkaravardhana of the PuÈpabhÂti dynasty and the sister of the illustrious king Sri Harsha. It is established that Sri Harsha founded an era in 457 BCE. Undoubtedly, the marriage of Grahavarman and RÀjyaœrÁ took place prior to 457 BCE. We will discuss the Sri Harsha era in detail in",

    "content": ". The Maukhari kings Avantivarman and Grahavarman were in all probability the descendants of the Maukharis of the Gaya region. Historians concocted the fable that Grahavarman was the grandson of Œarvavarman but the Nalanda seal22 clearly tells us that the name of Œarvavarman’s grandson must start with “Sucha” or “Su”.23 Thus, THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n182 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Grahavarman was not the grandson of Œarvavarman. Therefore, Œarvavarman’s son Avantivarman and Grahavarman’s father Avantivarman cannot be the same personage. Moreover, as Œarvavarman was the brother of SÂryavarman and the Haraha inscription of SÂryavarman is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 611 (108-107 BCE), it follows that Grahavarman’s father Avantivarman flourished around 400 years before Œarvavarman’s son Avantivarman. According to the °ryamaðjuœrÁmÂlakalpa, Suvra was the successor of Graha. Suvra was probably, the son of Grahavarman. One ancient Nepali inscription i.e. the Paœupati inscription of Jayadeva24 tells us that the LiccÍavi king Œivadeva married the daughter of Bhogavarman, the crest-jewel of the illustrious Varmans of the Maukhari dynasty. This Nepali inscription is dated in Sri Harsha era 157 (300 BCE). Bhogavarman was probably the grandson of Grahavarman; he married the daughter of °dityasena whose Shahpur inscription25 is dated in Sri Harsha era 66 (391-390 BCE). The Haraha stone inscription26 of SÂryavarman and the Asirgarh copper seal of Œarvavarman27 give the genealogy of the Maukhari dynasty starting from MahÀrÀja Harivarman but the Shankarpur grant of MahÀrÀja Harivarman28 gives the genealogy starting from MahÀrÀja SÀlanaka and also tells us that MahÀrÀja Harivarman was a feudatory of the Gupta king Budhagupta. Harivarman, °dityavarman and Iœvaravarman were feudatories of the Gupta kings and were ruling at KÀnyakubja (Kanauj). Taking advantage of the decline of the Gupta Empire, Iœvaravarman’s son IœÀnavarman established the Maukhari Kingdom by defeating the °ndhras, the ŒÂlikas and the Gauças and became MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja. According to Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, KumÀragupta II defeated IœÀnavarman but he could not re-establish the authority of the Guptas over the Maukharis. IœÀnavarman successfully established himself as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja. He had two sons, SÂryavarman and Œarvavarman. SÂryavarman renovated a Œiva temple and recorded it in the Haraha stone inscription dated in KÃta era 611 (108-107 BCE) during the reign of his father IœÀnavarman. Œarvavarman, °dityavarman and Suchandravarman were the successors of IœÀnavarman.\n183 The MÀlava Gupta king °dityasena records in his Aphsad stone inscription29 that his great-grandfather KumÀragupta defeated the Maukhari king IœÀnavarman and that DÀmodaragupta also defeated a Maukhari king. Historians mistakenly identified IœÀnavarman of the Aphsad inscription with the IœÀnavarman of Haraha inscription and referred to the MÀlava Guptas as “Later Guptas”. The Shahpur inscription of °dityasena is dated in Sri Harsha era 66 (391-390 BCE). It may be noted that the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE. Therefore, IœÀnavarman of the Aphsad inscription was the earlier Maukhari king who lived before the IœÀnavarman of the Haraha inscription. Therefore, the MÀlava Gupta kings must be called the Early Guptas instead of the Later Guptas. The KadaÚba king KÀkusthavarman married off his daughter to the MÀlava Guptas and not the Imperial Guptas as erroneously concluded by historians. The chronology of the Maukharis can be re-constructed based on the above cited facts.

Sirpur was the capital city of this dynasty. The Sirpur stone inscription30 tells us that the Maukhari king SÂryavarman was the maternal grandfather of MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna who ruled Magadha around 100-80 BCE. TÁvaradeva was the grandfather of MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna. The Rajim and Baloda grants of TÁvaradeva31 used the box-headed script which was in use in Central India during the VÀkÀÇaka period. TÁvaradeva was the son of king Nannadeva, the grandson of king Indrabala and the great-grandson of king Udayana. Nannadeva had two sons, TÁvaradeva and Chandragupta. Harshagupta was the son of Chandragupta and married VÀsatÀ, the daughter of Maukhari king SÂryavarman. MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna, the son of Harshagupta and VÀsatÀ, had a long reign of 57 years.\n185 In CE Indrabala 160-140 BCE Nannadeva 140-120 BCE TÁvaradeva 120-100 BCE Chandragupta 100-80 BCE Harshagupta 80-55 BCE MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna 55 BCE - 2 CE Ajay Mitra Sastry argued32 that the SÂryavarman mentioned in the Sirpur inscription of MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna was not the Maukhari king because the Maukharis never ruled over Magadha as their territorial possessions were confined to Uttara Pradesh. He also opined that IœÀnavarman’s victory over the Gauças was just a raid. According to the Haraha inscription, IœÀnavarman established a strong Maukhari kingdom by defeating the °ndhras and the Gauças which would not have been possible without taking over Magadha. The Gupta Empire ended by the time of SÂryavarman. Undoubtedly, SÂryavarman consolidated the Maukhari kingdom in Magadha following the footsteps of his father. It is also possible that his brother Œarvavarman was ruling at Kanauj whereas SÂryavarman was ruling at Magadha after the death of their father IœÀnavarman. Thus, the SÂryavarman mentioned in the Sirpur inscription was undoubtedly the Maukhari king. Interestingly, MahÀœivagupta BÀlÀrjuna mentions his maternal uncle BhÀskaravarman who was probably the son of SÂryavarman. The Aulikaras The Aulikaras ruled over the western MÀlava region of Madhya Pradesh and Mandasor or DÀsapura was their capital. The Aulikara kings used the MÀlava-gaõa saÚvat in their inscriptions. The MÀlava-gaõa era was also known as the KÃta era. Thus, the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) was used by the Aulikaras. Initially, the Aulikaras were the feudatories of the Imperial Gupta kings but later, became independent rulers. The first family of the Aulikaras ruled around MÀlava-gaõa SaÚvat 430-510 (289-209 BCE). The Mandasor inscription of Naravarman32 is dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 461 (258 BCE) and the THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n186 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Gangadhar inscription of Viœvavarman33 is dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 481 (238 BCE). Bandhuvarman mentions Gupta King KumÀragupta I in his Mandasor inscription34 dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 493 (226 BCE). The chronology of the first family of the Aulikaras: MÀlava-gaõa era (719-718 BCE) In CE Jayavarman 430-445 289-274 BCE SiÚhavarman 445-460 274-259 BCE Naravarman 460-480 259-239 BCE Viœvavarman 480-492 239-227 BCE One Mandasor inscription35 dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 524 (195 BCE) tells us that King PrabhÀkara, a Gupta feudatory, was ruling at DÀsapura. A statement by VatsabhaÇÇi at the end of the inscription of Bandhuvarman talks about the renovation of the Sun temple built by Bandhuvarman. VatsabhaÇÇi records the year of renovation as 529 without referring to the name of the era but based on his statement [“when a considerably long time has passed away and some other kings also passed away”], it is not possible to justify the year 529 in the MÀlava- gaõa era. It is entirely probable that he was referring to the Œaka era that commenced in 583 BCE. The second family of the Aulikaras emerged around MÀlava-gaõa era 550 (169 BCE) and ruled over MÀlava as independent rulers. A stone slab inscription36 of PrakÀœadharman is dated in MÀlava-gaõa era 572 (147 BCE) and two Mandasor inscriptions37 of Yasodharman are dated in MÀlava-gaõa 589 (130 BCE). Yasodharman was the most prominent king of this family. The chronology of the second family of the Aulikaras: MÀlava-gaõa era (719-718 BCE) In CE Drumavardhana — — Jayavardhana — — Ajitavardhana — — VibhiÈaõavardhana — —\n187 RÀjyavardhana — — PrakÀœadharma 550-575 169-144 BCE Yaœodharma 575-600 144-119 BCE Yaœovarman of Kanauj The Nalanda stone inscription38 of the time of Yaœovarman has records that MÀlada, the son of a minister of King Yaœovarmadeva donated certain gifts to the temple that King BÀlÀditya erected at Nalanda in honour of the son of Œuddhodana i.e. the Buddha. Unfortunately, this inscription is not dated. “Gauçavaho”, a poetry written in MahÀrÀÈÇri Prakrit by VÀkpati and Jaina works like Prabandhakoœa of RÀjaœekhara SÂri and BappabhaÇÇi SÂri Caritam of MÀõikya SÂri are the main sources for the history of the reign of Yaœovarman. PrabhÀvaka-Caritam of PrabhÀchandra SÂri, VicÀrasÀra-Prakaraõa of Pradyumna SÂri and a PaÇÇÀvali by Ravivardhana Gaõi also tell us about BappabhaÇÇi SÂri, a Jaina schalor who was the junior contemporary of VÀkpati. According to the Gauçavaho, Yaœovarman was ruling at Kanauj; he conquered Magadha, Vaôga, Gauça and also defeated the PÀrasÁkas. The killing of the king of Gauça by Yaœovarman is the title story of the Prakrit poetry “Gauçavaho”. He probably became the most powerful king of North India. As recorded in Jaina sources, Yaœovarman’s son °marÀja became the king of Kanauj in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 811(91-92 CE). Yaœovarman had quite likely died by then. Thus, the rule of Yaœovarman can be fixed around 30-91 CE. VÀkpati, the author of “Gauçavaho”, was in the court of Yaœovarman and the famous Sanskrit poet BhavabhÂti was his senior contemporary. Kalhaõa states in his RÀjatarôgiõÁ that BhavabhÂti and VÀkpati were in the court of Yaœovarman (Kavi- VÀkpatirÀja-Œri-BhavabhÂtyÀdibhiÍ sevitaÍ...... YaœovarmÀ).39 Therefore, BhavabhÂti and VÀkpati flourished in the 1st century CE. According to Jaina Sources, Yaœovarman invaded and killed the Gauça king Dharma and imprisoned his court poet VÀkpati. VÀkpati wrote “Gauçavaho” during his confinement to please king Yaœovarman and thus became his court poet. The RÀjataraôgiõÁ of Kalhaõa mentions a war between the Kashmir King LalitÀditya and Yaœovarman. They entered into a peace treaty but LalitÀditya’s minister Mitraœarman THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n188 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA opposed it. Later, LalitÀditya defeated Yaœovarman comprehensively. Thus, the time of LalitÀditya can be fixed around the 1st century CE.

    "content": ". Gauçavaho also tells us that Yaœovarman defeated the PÀrasÁkas in the West. The PÀrasÁkas were the Sasanian kings of Persia. According to Jaina sources, °marÀja was the son and successor of Yaœovarman. °marÀja became the YuvarÀja of Kanauj in SaÚvat 807 (87-88 CE) and the king in SaÚvat 811 (91-92 CE). The era mentioned in the Jaina sources was the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era that commenced in 719-718 CE. Interestingly, the renowned Jaina scholar BappabhaÇÇi SÂri was educated by Siddhasena who happened to be the teacher of Yaœovarman’s son °marÀja. Thus, BappabhaÇÇi was not only the classmate of °marÀja but also became his teacher. Therefore, Jaina sources referred to BappabhaÇÇi as “°marÀjaguru”, “°marÀja- pratibodhakaÍ” etc. The VicÀrasÀra Prakaraõa of Pradyumna SÂri tells us that HarisÂri was born one thousand fifty five years after the nirvÀõa of Mahavira and Bappabhatti SÂri was born around 1300 years after the nirvÀõa of Mahavira.40 As discussed above, Mahavira attained NirvÀõa in 1189 BCE. According to BappabhaÇÇi SÂri Caritam, Prabandhakoœa and the PaÇÇÀvali of Ravivardhana Gaõi, BappabhaÇÇi SÂri was born in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 800 (80-81 CE) and died in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 895 (175-176 CE). The time of BappabhaÇÇi can be fixed around Mahavira-nirvÀõa SaÚvat 1269 to 1364 which validates the statement of Pradyumna SÂri that BappabhaÇÇi flourished around 1300 years after Mahavira-nirvÀõa. BappabhaÇÇi was born on the 3rd tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month and in Hasta nakœatra. The date corresponds regularly to 6th August 80 CE.41 Therefore, Yaœovarman flourished around 30-91 CE and not in the 8th century CE as concluded by the eminent historians. According to the Chacha-NÀmÀ,42 Rai Harachandra, the son of Jahtal, was ruling at Kanauj during the time of Muhammad bin Kasim (695- 715 CE). Kasim sent his emissary to Kanauj and coerced Harachandra to acknowledge his suzerainty and embrace Islam. But Harachandra\n189 replied, “This country (of Kanauj) for about one thousand and six hundred years has been under our rule. During our sovereignty no enemy has ever dared to encroach on our boundary. Now go back to your master and tell him that we are ready for war.” The generals of Kasim urged him to declare war but Kasim died before any such war could take place. According to the Chacha-NÀmÀ, Kasim killed the Hindu king DÀhir and annexed Sindh and Multan. He sent the daughters of King DÀhir as presents to the Khalifa. The daughters of king DÀhir tricked the Khalifa into believing that Kasim had already violated them. The furious Khalifa ordered Kasim to be stitched in ox hides which resulted in his death. The Chacha-NÀmÀ clearly tells us that it was King Harachandra who was ruling at Kanauj around 715 CE and not Yaœovarman. Therefore, the Vikrama era used in Jaina sources must be the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and not the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). Thus, Yaœovarman flourished in the 1st century CE and cannot be a contemporary of Mohammad bin Kasim. King Harachandra was a contemporary of Kasim in the 8th century. Chacha-NÀmÀ also tells us that a king named Siharasa, the son of Rasal, was ruling in Kanauj in the 7th century during the reign of Chandara, the king of Sind. The Rai dynasty was supplanted by a BrÀhmaõa minister Chacha in Sind. Chandara, the brother of Chacha, succeeded him. King DÀhir was the son of the Brahmaõa king Chacha. Western historians and their blind followers either distorted the facts or ignored them to justify their distorted chronology as there is no reference of Yaœovarman in Chacha-NÀmÀ. Some historians even distorted Siharasa to be the famous Sri Harsha but Sri Harsha was the son of PrabhÀkaravardhana not Rasal. It is also believed by historians that Yaœovarman was the contemporary of the so-called Later Guptas. Actually, the Later Guptas ought to be called the ‘Early Guptas’ because they flourished prior to the rise of the Imperial Guptas. Therefore, Yaœovarman cannot be a contemporary of the so-called Later Guptas. According to the Early Chalukya (Malayur and Nerur) grants43 dated in Œaka 622 (39 CE), VinayÀditya (19-35 CE) defeated the king of the whole of North India (ŒakalottarÀpatha-nÀtha-mathanopÀrjjitorjjita- THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n190 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA pÀlidhvajÀdi-samsta-paramaiœvarya-cihnasya). VijayÀditya (36-72 CE) also defeated the king of North India and despite being captured by the retreating enemies, he managed to re-establish his authority (GaôgÀ- YamunÀ-PÀlidhvaja-pada-dhakka-mahÀœabda-cihnaka-manikya-mataôgajÀdin pitrisat kurvan paraiÍ palÀyamÀnairÀsÀdya kathamapi vidhivaœÀdapanitopi pratÀpÀd....). The ruler of North India defeated by VinayÀditya was either Yaœovarman or his immediate predecessor and VijayÀditya was a contemporary of Yaœovarman. The PratÁhÀras The PratÁhÀras trace their origin from Lakœmaõa who acted as the “PratÁhÀra” (Door-keeper) of his elder brother RÀma during his fight with MeghanÀda. According to Puranic tradition, KÀmadhenu of Rishi VasiÈÇha was forcibly taken away by ViœvÀmitra. Rishi VasiÈÇha performed a Yajða in “Agnikunça” at Mount Arbuda (Abu). Four AgnivaÚœas or BrÀhmaõa-Kœatriya dynasties i.e. PratÁhÀra, ParamÀra, Chaulukya and ChÀhamÀna were born out of the Agnikunça. The PratÁhÀras occupied Avanti and established their kingdom at Ujjain in the 1st century CE. PratÁhÀras used the KÀrittikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) in their inscriptions. NÀgabhaÇa I established his kingdom by defeating Valacha, the MleccÍa king and became the first PratÁhÀra king of Ujjain. He also conquered the invincible Gurjaras. The RÀÈÇrakÂta king Dantidurga probably defeated NÀgabhaÇa I around 87-92 CE. Hiraõyagarbham rÀjanyair UjjayinyÀm yadÀsthitam | PratÁhÀrÁ-kÃtam yena GurjareœÀdi-rÀjakam || 44 According to the Gwalior praœasti45 of Mihira-Bhoja, KÀkustha or Kakkuka succeeded NÀgabhaÇa I. He was the son of the brother of NÀgabhaÇa I. KÀkustha’s younger brother DevarÀja succeeded him. DevarÀja’s son VatsarÀja was the famous PratÁhÀra king who forcibly wrested the empire from the BhÀnçi clan. Udyotana SÂri, the author of KuvalayamÀlÀ, mentions that King VatsarÀja was ruling Avanti in Œaka 700 (117 CE). According to a Jaina PurÀõa “HarivaÚœa” written by Jinasena, VatsarÀja was ruling in Avanti, IndrÀyudha in the North and Srivallabha in the South around Œaka 705 elapsed (122-123 BCE). An inscription of VatsarÀja46 is dated in Œaka 717 elapsed (134-135 BCE).\n191 VatsarÀja’s son NÀgabhaÇa II was the most successful PratÁhÀra king. He defeated the °ndhra, Saindhava, Vidarbha and Kaliôga kings. He also defeated ChakrÀyudha and the king of Vaôga. He took away the hill forts of the °narta, MÀlava, KirÀta, TurÂÈaka, Vatsa, Matsya and other kings. The Pathari pillar inscription47 of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Parabala mentions that Parabala’s father KarkarÀja fought with the king NÀgÀvaloka. NÀgabhaÇa II was probably referred to as NÀgÀvaloka. The Buchkala inscription48 of NÀgabhaÇa II is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 872 (153-154 CE). The PratÁhÀras took control over KÀnyakubja or Kanauj during the reign of NÀgabhaÇa II. RÀmabhadra succeeded NÀgabhaÇa II. RÀmabhadra’s son Bhoja I or Mihira-Bhoja expanded the PratÁhÀra kingdom from Sind in the West to Vaôga in the East and NarmadÀ in the South. The earliest inscription of Bhoja I49 was dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 893 (174 CE). The Deogarh pillar inscription50 of Bhoja I is dated in Œaka era 784 (200-201 CE) and also in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 919 (200-201 CE). Interestingly, the Ahar inscription51 of the time of Bhoja I consists of 10 documents with 10 different dates. One date is given in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and other nine dates are given in the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). The fourth document is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 943 (224 CE) while the third, eighth & tenth documents are dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 298 (241 CE). The earliest inscription of Bhoja I’s son MahendrapÀla is dated in 955 (236 CE). Thus, Bhoja I may have ruled for at least 60 years from 174 CE to 234 CE and died in 241 CE. The Ahar inscription is the earliest epigraphic evidence that the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) came into use in the beginning of the 3rd century CE. Historians speculated that the nine documents of the Ahar Inscription are dated in the Sri Harsha era considering the fictitious epoch of the Sri Harsha era in 606 CE. In reality, the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE. We will discuss the epoch of the Sri Harsha era in",

    "content": ". It appears that the PratÁhÀra Empire declined after Bhoja I or Mihira- Bhoja. MahendrapÀla succeeded Bhoja I. It is very likely that the rise of the Chedi kingdom at Tripuri near Jabalpur in 3rd century may have been the reason behind the decline of the PratÁhÀras. The Sudi plates52 of Ganga king Butuga II and the Kudlur plates53 of MÀrasiÚha tell us about THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n192 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the Chedi king Vandyaga or Baddiga and his younger brother Krishna who established a kingdom by defeating the Magadha, Kaliôga, PÀnçya and Chola kings. After MahendrapÀla, Bhoja II and his half-brother VinÀyakapÀla ascended the throne.

The Dongargaon inscription54 of Jagaddeva also mentions this mythological origin of the ParamÀras (KÀmadhenu-hÃtavate ViœvÀmitrÀya kupyataÍ | VasiÈÇhÀttatra homÀgnau ParamÀro vyajÀyata || ). It appears that ParamÀra or PramÀra was the progenitor of this dynasty. According to the Udaypur Praœasti55 and the NavasÀhasÀôkacarita of Padmagupta, UpendrarÀja was the founder of the ParamÀra kingdom of MÀlava. While the Harsola Grant56 of Siyaka mentions BappaiyarÀja as the earliest ParamÀra king, the Dharmapuri grant57 of VÀkpati mentions KrishnarÀja as the earliest\n193 ParamÀra king leading to the surmise that BappaiyarÀja and KrishnarÀja were the same person; it is also probable that VÀkpatiraja I of the Udayapur Praœasti and the NavasÀhasÀôkacarita was referred to as BappaiyarÀja and KrishanrÀja. UpendrarÀja was the great grandfather of VÀkpatirÀja I. The ParamÀras also used KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 BCE) in their inscriptions. Some historians have speculated that the ParamÀras were initially either feudatories or members of the imperial RÀÈÇrakÂÇa dynasty. This speculation is based purely on the Harsola grant that refers to “AmoghavarÈa” and “AkÀlavarÈa”. It may be noted that the ParamÀra kings also patronised Jainism in their kingdom. The ParamÀra king Siyaka explicitly mentions in his Harsola grant that “AmoghavarÈa” and “AkÀlavarÈa” were his ancestors and that his father BappaiyarÀja was born in their dynasty (tasmin kule). Thus, it is absurd to link the ParamÀras with the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. Though UpendrarÀjÀ was the founder, it was KrishnarÀja or BappaiyarÀja or VÀkpatirÀja I who was the first independent ruler of the ParamÀra dynasty. DhÀrÀ city in Madhya Pradesh was the capital of the ParamÀra dynasty. Siyaka II succeeded VÀkpatirÀja I. The Udaypur Praœasti refers to Siyaka II as Sri Harshadeva who defeated KhoÇÇigadeva and annexed his kingdom (KhoÇÇigadeva-lakœmÁm jagrÀha yo yudhi....). Eminent historians assumed that the KhoÇÇiga mentioned in the Udaypur Praœasti was a RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king. The inscriptions of RÀÈÇrakÂÇa KhoÇÇiga are dated in the ŒÀlivÀhana era and the period of his reign was around 968-972 CE whereas Siyaka II flourished around 285-308 CE because his inscriptions are dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 1005-1026. The KhoÇÇigadeva mentioned in ParamÀra inscriptions was probably a Chedi king. VÀkpatirÀja II succeeded Siyaka II. He was also referred to as Muðja in the Nagpur Praœasti.58 According to the Udaypur Praœasti, VÀkpatirÀja II established his authority in KarõÀta, LÀta, Kerala and Chola (KarõÀta- LÀÇa-Kerala-Chola-œiroratna-rÀgi-pÀda-kamalaÍ). It seems that the Chedi king YuvarÀja challenged VÀkpatirÀja II whom he successfully defeated in Tripuri, the capital of Chedi kingdom (YuvarÀjam vijityÀjau hatvÀ tadvÀhinÁpatÁn | KhaçgamÂrdhvÁkÃtam yena TripuryÀm vijigÁÈuõÀ|| ). SindhurÀja, the younger brother of VÀkpatirÀja II, succeeded him. His THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n194 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA major achievement was his victory over the HÂõas (tasyÀnujo nirjita- HÂõa-rÀjaÍ). Padmagupta, the author of NavasÀhasÀôkacaritam was in the court of SindhurÀja and according to him, SindhurÀja conquered Kuntala, VÀgada, Murala, LÀÇa, AparÀnta, Kosala and HÂõas. Bhojadeva, the son of SindhurÀja, was one of the most celebrated kings of Indian history. The Kalvan grant59 of the time of Bhojadeva tells us that he ruled over KarõÀÇa, LÀÇa, Gurjara, Chedi and Koôkaõa (KarõÀÇa-LÀÇa-Gurjara-ChedyÀdhipa-Koôkaõeœa-prabÃti-ripu-varga-nirdhÀrita- janita-trÀsa-yaœo-dhavalita-bhuvana-trayaÍ). Bhojadeva issued the Betma grant60 on the occasion of his victory over Koôkaõa. According to Udaipur Praœasti,61 Bhojadeva subjugated the kings of Chedi, Indraratha, KarõÀÇa, LÀÇa, Gurjara and TuruÈka (Chediœvarendraratha...... KarõÀÇa- LÀÇapati-GurjararÀt-TuruÈkÀn). Historians wrongly identified TuruÈkas with Arabs. Kalhaõa mentions that HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka were born in the dynasty of TuruÈka (Te TuruÈkÀnvayodbhÂtÀÍ).62 Thus, the TuruÈkas existed since ancient times in what is today modern North-western Pakistan. The Udaipur Praœasti also tells us that Bhojadeva ruled from KailÀœa in the North to Malayagiri in the South and from the Western ghats to the Eastern Ghats (AkailÀsÀn-Malaya- girito’stodayÀdridvayÀdÀbhukta-pÃthvÁm pÃthu). His kingdom was protected by KedÀranÀth in the North, RÀmeœvara in the South, SomanÀtha in the West and ŒuôdÁra-KÀlÀnala-Rudra in the East (KedÀra-RÀmeœvara- SomanÀtha-ŒuôdÁra-KÀlÀnala-Rudra-satkaiÍ SurÀœrayairvyÀpya ca yaÍ samantÀdyathÀrtasaÚjðam jagatÁm cakÀra). According to the Pattana Manuscript Catalogue,63 Bhojadeva subjugated the kings of Draviça, LÀÇa, Vaôga, Gauça, Gurjara, KÁra and KÀmboja and also terrorised the kings of Choça, °ndhra, KarõÀÇa, Gurjara, Chedi and KÀnyakubja. It is evident from the ParamÀra inscriptions that Bhojadeva ruled over the whole of North India and KarõÀÇaka in South India. Bhojadeva’s inscriptions are dated in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) from 1067 (348 CE) to 1103 (384 CE). The RÀjamÃgÀôkakaraõa mentions that Bhoja was ruling in Œaka 964 (381 CE). Bhoja was still on the throne when the “CintÀmaõi-SÀraõika” was composed by his court-poet Daœabala in Œaka 977 (394 CE). According to Merutuôga and Bhojaprabandha of Ballaladeva, Bhoja ruled for fifty-five years, seven months and three\n195 days (PaðcÀœat-paðca-varÈÀõi saptamÀsÀ dinatrayam|BhojarÀjena bhoktavyaÍ sagaudo dakœiõÀpathaÍ|| ) Therefore, the time of Bhojadeva can be fixed around 338-394 CE. Colonial historians knew only one epoch of Vikrama era (57 BCE) and believed that Bhoja ruled around 1010-1060 CE. Since it is not possible to prove the overlordship of the ParamÀras over KarõÀÇaka during the 10th and 11th centuries, historians rejected the claims of the Udaipur Praœasti as poetry and not historical facts. They also doubted the defeat of the Chedi kings because there is no definite evidence to prove it in the 10th and 11th centuries. In fact, Bhojadeva flourished in the 4th century CE and not in the 11th century CE. As recorded in the Sudi plates of the Gaôga king Butuga II, a powerful kingdom of Chedis was established in the 3rd century CE. The ParamÀras defeated the Chedi kings to expand their kingdom. There are numerous references in the ParamÀra inscriptions about the subjugation of the Chedi kings. It is also recorded in the Udaipur Praœasti that Bhojadeva’s successor UdayÀditya killed the ruler of DÀhala deœa or Chedi kingdom (DÀhalÀdhÁœa-saÚhÀra-vajra-dança ivÀparaÍ). Thus, in the 4th century CE, the ParamÀra dynasty established a powerful empire in North India and in Karnataka & Bengal as well. Bhojadeva, who ruled around 338-394 CE, was the most illustrious king of the ParamÀras and he may well have been the most successful king of India after Samudragupta and Chandragupta II. The VÀdnagar Praœasti of KumÀrapÀla64 refers to Bhoja as “MÀlava Chakravartin”. Bhoja was a learned king and a great Sanskrit poet who wrote the “SaraswatÁkaõÇhÀbharaõa” on poetics, the “SamarÀôgaõasÂtradhÀra” on architecture and the “RÀjamÀrtÀõça” on YogaœÀstra etc. He authored a Karaõa treatise “RÀjamÃgÀôka” in KV 1100 (381 CE). He was a great patron of learning and according to the Patna inscription,65 Bhaskaracharya’s great grandfather BhÀskarabhaÇÇa received the title of VidyÀpati from him. He rebuilt the city of DhÀrÀ and also constructed a Sanskrit MahÀvidyÀlaya (college) in DhÀrÀ, now occupied by a mosque. It is well known that Mahmud Gazni invaded and plundered India seventeen times between 1008 CE to 1025 CE. It was the second terrorist invasion on India after Kasim’s invasion in 712 CE. He defeated the THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n196 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA confederacy of the Indian kings of Ujjain, Gwalior, KÀlinjar, Kanauj, Delhi and Ajmer in 1008 CE. He plundered Mathura, Thanesar, Kanauj, Meerut etc. many times around 1017-1021 CE. He invaded Gwalior in 1023 CE and Ajmer, Kathiawar in 1024 CE. Mahmud Gazni plundered the SomanÀth temple in 1024 CE and massacred over 50,000 people and personally hammered the divine “Œivaliôgam” into pieces. This terrorist invader carried back the Œivaliôgam stone fragments to his capital Gazni where they were used in the construction of the steps of a new Jama Masjid. None of the Persian sources of this period mention the Indian king Bhojadeva who was the most powerful king of North India. It is unbelievable that the Great Bhojadeva was flourishing in MÀlava while Mahmud Gazni was plundering an entire section of North-western India. Evidently, the MÀlava Chakravarti Bhojadeva flourished in the 4th century and not in 11th century. The Sanskrit poet Soççhala authored his famous work UdayasundarÁkathÀ during the reign of VatsarÀja, the Chaulukya king of LÀÇa (Gujarat) and MummuõirÀja, the SilÀhÀra king of North Konkan.66 King TrilochanapÀla was the son of VatsarÀja and his copper plate inscription is dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 972 (1050 CE).67 The inscriptions of MummuõirÀja are dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 970 (1048 CE), 971 (1049 CE), 975 (1053 CE), 982 (1060 CE).68 King NÀgÀrjuna, the brother of MummuõirÀja was ruling prior to him and his Thana plates are dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 961 (1039 CE).69 It is evident that the SilÀhÀra King MummuõirÀja reigned around 1040-1061 CE. The reign of the Chaulukya King VatsarÀja ended by 1049 CE because his son TrilochanapÀla started ruling from 1049 CE. Thus, it can be concluded that Soççhala wrote the UdayasundarÁkathÀ between 1040 CE to 1049 CE. If the ParamÀra King Bhojadeva was ruling around 1010-1060 CE as arrived at by the eminent historians, Soççhala was not only a contemporary of Bhojadeva but also the latter was certainly alive when the UdayasundarÁkathÀ was written. Soççhala has mentioned VikramÀditya, Harsha, Muðja, Bhoja as the great learned kings of past. It is evident that ParamÀra Bhoja was a king of the past and that he flourished in the 4th century CE and not in the 11th century CE. The Kalachuri king Sodhadeva’s grant dated in Chaitradi Vikrama era 1135 (1078 CE) also tells us that Bhojaraja was king before many generations. We will discuss Sodhadeva’s grant in",

According to the Udaipur Praœasti, the DhÀrÀ kingdom was filled with dense darkness after the death of Bhojadeva. Emboldened by his death, the Chedi king invaded DhÀrÀ and various other enemy kings also tried to regain their lost territories until UdayÀditya, the bandhu or a relative of Bhojadeva (as mentioned in the Nagpur Museum stone inscription of Naravarman71), killed the Chedi king and re-established the authority of the ParamÀras. UdayÀditya’s son Naravarman succeeded him. The Mandhata grant72 of Jayavarman II dated in KV 1331 (612 CE) gives the complete genealogy of the ParamÀra dynasty.

It is evident that king UdayÀditya II (Aribalamathana) re- established the ParamÀra kingdom in 1059 CE. As a matter of fact, the Sanskrit used in this inscription appears to have been misinterpreted by historians resulting in a distorted translation where Aribalamathana is identified as the father of UdayÀditya whereas it was only an honorific or term of praise for UdayÀditya meaning the destroyer of enemy forces. Similarly, SÂravira was also used as a term of praise for GÀndaladeva. Interestingly, this inscription explicitly tells us that UdayÀditya II re- established the ParamÀra kingdom after 446 years (gata-pada-veda- œatÀdhika-catvÀriÚœayad-gateyasairgya 446 pÂrva-nÃpa-gata-saÚhyatakana- prabhÃti....). The last inscription of the early ParamÀras i.e. the Mandhata Grant of Jayavarman II is dated in KV 1331 (612 CE) and seems to suggest that the ParamÀras lost their kingdom in the year 612-613 CE. UdayÀditya II, the son of GÀndaladeva, re-established the ParamÀra kingdom in 1058- 59 CE exactly after the completion of 446 years. It is the strongest epigraphic evidence that the ParamÀra dynasty ruled around the 4th to 7th centuries CE and not around the 10th to 13th centuries CE and also clearly substantiates that the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era cannot be fixed in 57 BCE. Thus, the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era is different from the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era and it commenced in 719-718 BCE. Interestingly, historians could not understand the reference to 446 years in the inscription of UdayÀditya II.\n199 HT Prinsep thought it was a new era established by UdayÀditya II with the epoch around 618 CE. Some historians ridiculously added 446 years to 1116 years to establish the rule of UdayÀditya II around 1506 CE which is nothing but a forgery.74 Three inscriptions75 found at Kolanupaka, Bhuvanagiri, Nalgonda District in Telangana tell us that Jagaddeva, the son of UdayÀditya II and the grandson of Gondala, was ruling as the feudatory of the KalyÀõi Chalukya king Tribhuvanamalla around 1104 CE (the 29th year of Chalukya Vikrama era). The third inscription at Kolanupaka clearly mentions that when important ParamÀra kings like Œri Harsha, Muðja, Sindhala, Bhoja, etc. and many other descendant kings of the same dynasty flourished and thereafter King Gondila was born (Œri Harsha- MuðjanÃpa-Sindhala-Bhojadeva-mukhyeÈu rÀja-kamalÀmanubhÂtavatsu| tadvaÚœajeÈu bahuÈu kœitipÀlakeÈu jÀtastatas-tadanu Gondila-bhÂmipÀlaÍ || ) and his son UdayÀditya II ruled the city of DhÀrÀ (RÀjyam cakÀra DhÀrÀyÀmudayÀdityadevaÍ). Jagaddeva was the son of UdayÀditya II and became a feudatory of the KalyÀõi Chalukya king Tribhuvanamalla. The Dongargaon stone inscription76 of the time of Jagaddeva dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 1034 (1112 CE) tells us Bhojadeva II of the ParamÀra dynasty became the king who was like RÀma (tadvaÚœe.... babhÂva BhojadevÀkhyo rÀjÀ RÀmasamo guõaiÍ). After him, the MÀlava kingdom was subjugated by three enemies (tato riputrayaskande magnÀm MÀlava- medinÁm). Bhojadeva II’s cousin UdayÀditya II re-established the rule of the ParamÀra dynasty (uddharan UdayÀdityaÍ tasya bhrÀtÀ oyavarddhata). This is stated in the inscription found at Sagar as well. According to Inscription-I found at Kolanupaka,77 Gondala was the father of UdayÀditya II and the uncle (tasya pitÃvyaÍ) of Bhojadeva II. The Jainad inscription78 also mentions that BhojarÀja II was the uncle of Jagaddeva (pitÃvyaÍ sa ca BhojarÀjaÍ). It is absurd to conclude that UdayÀditya I was the brother of BhojarÀja I. BhojarÀja I ruled for 55 years, 7 months & 3 days and possibly died at the age of 80. His son JayasiÚha also ruled for a few years (around 5 years). Thus, UdayÀditya I ascended the throne 60 years after the date of the coronation of BhojarÀja I and reigned for at least 23 years. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that UdayÀditya I was the brother or THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n200 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA cousin of BhojarÀja I. This is the reason why the Nagpur Museum inscription simply mentions that UdayÀditya I was the bandhu (meaning a relative) of BhojarÀja I. Moreover, the inscriptions of the ParamÀra dynasty do not mention Jagaddeva and his grandfather Gondala clearly indicating that Gondala, BhojarÀja II, UdayÀditya II and Jagaddeva were the later ParamÀra kings who flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries CE. Thus, it is evident that UdayÀditya I was the bandhu or just a relative of Bhojadeva I whereas UdayÀditya II was the cousin of Bhojadeva II. Historians claim that Alberuni mentions Bhoja, the ruling king of DhÀrÀ when he visited India during 1017-1030 CE.79 In reality, Bhojadeva II was ruling in DhÀrÀ around 1025 CE and therefore, the Bhoja referred to by Alberuni was Bhojadeva II and not the great MÀlava king Bhojadeva I who flourished in the 4th century CE. UdayÀditya II had many sons. Though Jagaddeva had the opportunity to become the king after the death of his father, he relinquished his claim in favour of his elder brother (divam prayÀte pitari svayam praptÀmapi œriyam, parivittibhayam tyaktvÀ yo’grajÀya nyavedayat |) and became a close associate of the Kuntala king i.e. the KalyÀõi Chalukya king Tribhuvanamalla. The earliest inscription of Jagaddeva is dated in year 29 of the Chalukya Vikrama era (1104 CE) and the Kamagiri inscription of Jagaddeva80 is dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 1051 (1129 CE). Historians wrongly identified the elder brother of Jagaddeva to be Naravarman and Lakœmadeva. In fact, Lakœmadeva and Naravarman were the sons of UdayÀditya I whereas Jagaddeva was the son of UdayÀditya II. The chronology of Later ParamÀra kings: In ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) In CE Gondala or Gandala — — BhojarÀja II — 1025-1050 CE UdayÀditya II 981-1120 1058-1098 CE Jagaddeva 1026-1051 1104-1129 CE There is a serious need to re-write the entire tract of ancient and early mediaeval history of India and the chronology must be\n201 reconctructed considering the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 BCE). According to Abul Fazl of Ain-e-Akbari, Jitpal Chauhan conquered North-western MÀlava by defeating Kamaluddin in 1069 CE81 which clearly indicates that the ParamÀra dynasty was not ruling over North-western MÀlava in the 11th century CE. It is quite likely that UdayÀditya II could recover only some territories of Madhyadeœa including the city of DhÀrÀ around 1058-59 CE. Thus, the great ParamÀra dynasty ruled around the 4th to 7th centuries CE and the later ParamÀra king UdayÀditya II re-established himself around 1058-59 CE for a short period. It seems that the ParamÀras finally lost their kingdom by the end of the 11th century CE and UdayÀditya II was the last known independent ruler of this dyanasty. The Chaulukyas (Solankis) of Gujarat The Chaulukya dynasty was also one of the four dynasties born out of the Agnikunda of Rishi VasiÈÇha. The Chaulukya kingdom was in Northern Gujarat and AnhilapÀtan or Anhilwad was its capital city. The Chaulukyas were the successors of the ChÀvaça kings. According to VicÀraœreõi of Merutuôga (644 CE),82 VanarÀja, the founder of the Somachauda or ChÀvaça dyanasty, built the city of Anhilapura on the 2nd tithi of the bright fortnight of VaiœÀkha month in KV 821 i.e. 7th April 102 CE but the TapagaccÍa PaÇÇÀvali mentions that VanarÀja founded Anhilapura in KV 802 (83 CE). The ChÀvaça dynasty ruled for 196 years from KV 821 to 1018 (102-299 CE).

His son ChÀmuõçarÀja who succeeded him and reigned for 14 years, had two sons, VallabharÀja and DurlabharÀja, of whom VallabharÀja died within six months of his accession and was succeeded by his brother DurlabharÀja who reigned for 12 years until KV 1079 (360 CE). He was succeeded by Bhimadeva I, the son of NÀgarÀja, the younger brother of DurlabharÀja. Bhimadeva I and his son Karõadeva ruled between KV 1079 and 1152 (360-433 CE). SiddharÀja JayasiÚha ascended the throne in 433 CE and reigned for 47 years. Jaina scholar Hemachandra SÂri was in the court of SiddharÀja and authored the “Siddha-Haima-ŒabdÀnuœÀsana” on grammar. According to Jaina sources, SiddharÀja wanted to kill his nephew KumÀrapÀla but Hemachandra saved him by hiding him under a pile of manuscripts. Merutuôga tells us that SiddharÀja JayasiÚha died on the 3rd tithi of the bright fortnight of KÀrttika month in KV 1199 i.e. 22nd October 480 CE and KumÀrapÀla ascended the throne on the 4th tithi of the bright fortnight of MÀrgaœÁrÈa month i.e. 21st November 480 CE. Hemachandra also tells us that KumÀrapÀla was coronated in Mahavira- nirvÀõa saÚvat 1669 (480 CE). As discussed above, Mahavira attained nirvÀõa in 1189 BCE. The VÀdnagar Praœasti83 was composed by the poet ŒripÀla on the ramparts of Nagara-°nandapura built in KV 1208 (489 CE) by king KumÀrapÀla. Two additional verses were written in the same inscription on the renovation of the ramparts in KV 1689 (970 CE). Hemachandra influenced King KumÀrapÀla to declare Jainism as the official religion of Gujarat at the end of the 5th century CE. According to VicÀraœreõi, KumÀrapÀla died on the 12th tithi of the bright fortnight of PauÈa month in KV 1229 i.e. 28th December 510 CE. His successors AjayapÀla and MÂlarÀja II died on the 12th tithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month in KV 1232 i.e. 22nd February 514 CE and the 4th tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month in KV 1234 i.e. 22nd February 516 CE respectively. Bhimadeva II ascended the throne in KV 1235 (517 CE) who according to Meruttuôga, reigned for 63 years.\n203 The Chronology of the Chaulukya dynasty: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE MÂlarÀja 1018-1053 299-334 CE ChÀmuõçarÀja 1053-1067 334-348 CE VallabharÀja 1067-1067 348-348 CE DurlabharÀja 1068-1079 349-360 CE Bhimadeva I 1079-1128 360-409 CE Karõadeva 1128-1152 409-433 CE SiddharÀja JayasiÚha 1152-1199 433-480 CE KumÀrapÀla 1199-1229 480 -510 CE AjayapÀla 1230-1232 511-514 CE MÂlarÀja II 1232-1234 514-516 CE Bhimadeva II 1235-1298 517-579 CE TribhuvanapÀla 1298-1300 579-581 CE According to the VicÀraœreõi of Merutuôga, VÁsaladeva, the son of VÁradhavala and the grandson of Raõaka LavaõaprasÀda, ascended the throne of Anhilwad in KV 1300 (581 CE). Dhavala, the grandfather of LavaõaprasÀda was married to the sister of KumÀrapÀla’s mother. Thus, VÁsaladeva belonged to another branch of the Chaulukyas.

The manuscript of Hemachandra’s DeœÁnÀmamÀlÀ and DhÀtupÀrÀyaõavÃtti were written in KV 1298 (586 CE) [SaÚvat 1298 varÈe °œvina œudi 10 ravau adyeha BhÃgukaccÍe MahÀraõaka Œri-VÁsaladeva..] and KV 1307 (588 CE) [SaÚvat 1307 varÈe Chaitra vadi 13 bhaume Œri-VÁsaladeva-kalyÀõa-vijaya- rÀjye] respectively and the manuscript of UttarÀdhyayanavÃtti was written in KV 1310 (591 CE) [SaÚvat 1310 varÈe MÀgha œudi 13 ravau PuÈyarkœe MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja-Œri-VÁsaladeva-kalyÀõa-vijaya-rÀjye].84 The chronology of the Chaulukyas given by Merutuôga and other Jaina sources is amazingly accurate and is in full agreement with the epigraphic evidence. The Chaulukya kings used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) in their inscriptions and ruled from the 4th to 7th centuries CE. Ancient Jaina sources also refer to the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. Unfortunately, historians considered only the epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) and fixed the rule of the Chaulukyas around the 11th to 13th centuries CE that led to the distortion of numerous facts. 1. It is well known fact that Mahmud Gazni invaded Anhilwad and looted the SomanÀth temple in 1024 CE but the Jaina sources and the inscriptions of the Chaulukyas have no direct or indirect reference of the invasion of Mahmud Gazni and the destruction of SomanÀth temple. 2. VicÀraœreõi of Merutuôga mentions that the Gajjanakas ruled after the fall of the Chaulukyas (tato GajjanakarÀjyam). Historians concocted the myth that Gajjanakas meant Muslims but there is no credible evidence to prove it. 3. The genealogy given in the grant85 of the later Chaulukya TrilochanapÀla dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 972 (1050 CE) is completely different from the genealogy of the Chaulukyas of Anhilwad. According to this grant, a Chaulukya king married the daughter of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king of Kanauj. BÀrapparÀja, a descendant of this Chaulukya-RÀÈÇrakÂÇa lineage, established his kingdom in the LÀÇadeœa of Gujarat in 10th century CE. The genealogy of TrilochanapÀla:\n205 ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) In CE BÀrapparÀja 880-900 958-978 CE GongirÀja 900-930 978-1008 CE KÁrtirÀja 930-950 1008-1028 CE VatsarÀja 950-971 1028-1049 CE TrilochanapÀla 971-990 1049-1068 CE This grant also tells us that King VatsarÀja presented the “Hemaratnaprabham cÍatram” (an umbrella resplendent with gold and jewels) to SomanÀth temple. The UdayasundarÁ KathÀ of Soççhala also refers to king GongirÀja (YogirÀja), king KÁrtirÀja and king VatsarÀja. In fact, Soççhala wrote his work during the reign of VatsarÀja and it is entirely probable that KirtirÀja was the ruler of LÀÇadeœa during the invasion of Mahmud Gazni. Historians wrongly concluded that VatsarÀja and TrilochanapÀla were contemporary kings of the Chaulukya MÂlarÀja. All Jaina literary sources unanimously tell us that MÂlarÀja was the first Chaulukya king in Gujarat; he flourished in the 4th century CE whereas the Chaulukya-RÀÈÇrakÂÇa kings ruled in LÀÇadeœa around the 10th and 11th centuries CE. 4. According to later Muslim historians and the Ain-e-Akbari, Mahmud Gazni invaded during the reign of Jamund (probably, ChÀmunda) and placed the descendant of the Dabishlim on the throne of Anhilwad. Some historians tried to identify the Dabishlim with Durlabhasena (DurlabharÀja).86 If ChÀmundaraja and DurlabharÀja are placed around 1024 CE, the entire chronology of the Chaulukyas given by Jaina sources gets disarranged. Moreover, the chronology given by Jain sources is perfectly proven by epigraphic evidence. Therefore, historians conveniently ignored the later Muslim sources and accepted the dates of Chaulukya kings recorded in Jaina sources. Actually, both the Jaina and Muslim sources are correct because the Jaina sources recorded the history of the 4th to 7th centuries CE whereas Muslim sources recorded the history of the 11th THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n206 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA century CE. This is precisely why Jaina sources and inscriptions of the Chaulukyas were oblivious of Mahmud’s invasion. It is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 719-718 BCE and not in 57 BCE. 5. According to some historians, the oldest account of the SomanÀth expedition is given by Ibn Asir. He stated that the chief of Anhilwad, called Bhim, fled to the fort of Kandahat. Historians identified the Bhim with Chaulukya king Bhimadeva I. There is no literary or epigraphic evidence available to prove that Mahmud invaded during the reign of Bhimadeva I. First of all, there is no authentic information from Muslim sources to establish the fact that either Jamund or Bhim was ruling AnhilwÀd in 1024 CE or Bhim. But, all Muslim sources unanimously tell us that Mahmud placed a descendant of Dabishlims on the throne of AnhilwÀd. 6. Bhimadeva I ruled around KV 1079-1128 (360-409 CE) and therefore, cannot be dated in the 11th century CE. This entire confusion was created by historians because they were ignorant of the two different epochs of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. If the chronology of the Chaulukyas is established in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era then the history recorded by Muslim sources can be easily explained. It is likely that ChÀmunda or Bhim was an official or a feudatory of the later Chaulukya king KirtirÀja ruling in LÀÇadeœa in 1024 CE. 7. According to Historians, the Veraval inscription87 of Chaulukya Arjunadeva is dated in Mohammad era 662, Vikrama era 1320 and SiÚha saÚvat 151. They have erroneously identified the Arjunadeva of Veraval inscription with VÁsaladeva’s successor Arjunadeva. A copper plate grant of VÁsaladeva is dated in KV 1317 (598 CE). Jaina scholar Merutuôga tells us that VÁradhavala had two sons, VÁramadeva and VÁsaladeva. VÁsaladeva ruled up to KV 1318 (599 CE). Arjunadeva succeeded him and ruled till KV 1331 (612 CE). SÀraôgadeva and Karõadeva were the successors of Arjunadeva. In my opinion, Arjunadeva of\n207 Merutuôga and Arjunadeva of the Veraval inscription were two different persons. Similarly, SÀraôgadeva of Merutuôga and SÀraôgadeva of the Cintra Praœasti88 were also two different persons. It appears that one later branch of the Chaulukyas led by Viœvamalla established their rule in Anhilwad in the beginning of the 13th century CE. Interestingly, this Kathiawar inscription of the time of SÀraôgadeva is now placed in the Cintra city of Portugal. According to this Cintra Praœasti, Viœvamalla was the founder of this branch. PratÀpamalla was his younger brother. Viœvamalla selected PratÀpamalla’s son Arjunadeva to be his successor. Arjunadeva’s son SÀraôgadeva succeeded him. It is evident that the genealogy given by Merutuôga is entirely different from the genealogy given in the Cintra Praœasti. Historians concocted that Viœvamalla and VÁsaladeva were the same personage. Actually, the Arjunadeva of the VÁsaladeva family ruled around 599-612 CE whereas the Arjunadeva of Viœvamalla ruled around 1263 CE. 8. The Vikrama era referred to in the Veraval and Cintra inscriptions is the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE); the expression “Œri-nÃpa-Vikrama SaÚvat” was never used for the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 CE). 9. Historians also argue that the Veraval inscription refers to SiÚha SaÚvat 151. SiÚha SaÚvat was founded by the Chaulukya king SiddharÀja JayasiÚha. Therefore, the Arjunadeva of the Veraval inscription and the Arjunadeva of Merutuôga were the same. A grant89 of Bhimadeva II is dated in KV 1266 (547 CE) and SiÚha SaÚvat 96. The calendar used in the grant of Bhimadeva II for SiÚha SaÚvat was KÀrttikÀdi. Therefore, it can be construed that the Chaulukya king SiddharÀja JayasiÚha founded the KÀrttikÀdi SiÚha SaÚvat or SiÚha era in 450-451 CE. If Vikrama 1266 is SiÚha 96 than Vikrama 1320 should be SiÚha 150. It is absurd to accept Vikrama 1320 as SiÚha 151. Moreover, Veraval inscription probably used the ChaitrÀdi calendar for SiÚha SaÚvat. Therefore, the ChaitrÀdi SiÚha era used in the Veraval inscription is different from the KÀrttikÀdi THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n208 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA SiÚha era used in the inscriptions of Bhimadeva II.

This date is irregular with reference to the epoch of SiÚha SaÚvat in 1112 CE. It corresponds regularly to 21st March 544 CE considering the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi SiÚha saÚvat in 450 CE. 11. According to the Vadnagar Praœasti, ChÀmunçarÀja waged a successful war against the king of Sindh (Œri-SindhurÀjastathÀ naÈtaÍ....). It is impossible because Sindh was under Muslim rule since 841 CE. Therefore, ChÀmunçarÀja ruled around KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama 1053-1067 (334-348 CE) and defeated a Hindu king of Sindh. Thus, it can be concluded that the inscriptions of the Chaulukyas and the VÁsaladeva branch of the Chaulukyas used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 CE) and reigned around the 4th to 7th centuries CE whereas the inscriptions of the Chaulukya-RÀÈÇrakÂÇa kings and the VÁsvamalla branch of the Chaulukyas used the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) and reigned in the 13th century CE. The ChÀhamÀnas of SapÀdalakœa or ŒakaÚbhari According to Puranic tradition, the ChÀhamÀna dynasty was also one of the four dynasties born out of Agnikunda of Rishi VasiÈÇha and ChÀhamÀna was the likely progenitor of this dynasty. Interestingly, the ChÀhamÀna dynasty has many branches. The earliest branch of the ChÀhamÀnas was reigning at BhÃgukaccÍa or Bharuch in Gujarat. The Hansot plates91 tell us that ChÀhamÀna king BhartÃvaddha was reigning in KV 813 (94-95 CE) as a feudatory of the PratÁhÀra king NÀgÀvaloka or NÀgabhaÇa I. Later, the ChÀhamÀna king SindhurÀja who was reigning in Bharuch in the 6th century who was a contemporary of Dholka Lavaõaprasada, the grandfather of the Chaulukya king VÁsaladeva and the YÀdava king Siôghaõa (560-585 CE).\n209 According to the Harsha stone inscription,92 the ChÀhamÀna king VigraharÀja was reigning in the region known as Ananta around KV 1030 (311 CE). The Bijolia rock inscription93 dated in KV 1226 (507 CE) also gives the genealogy of the ChÀhamÀna kings. The Menalgarh inscription94 dated in SaÚvat 1226 (507 CE) refers to the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (MÀlaveœa-gata-vatsara-œataiÍ dvÀdaœaiœca ÈaçviÚœa-pÂrvakaiÍ). AhiccÍatrapura was their first capital. According to the Bijolia inscription, ChÀhamÀna kings belonged to the Vatsa gotra and their ancestors were BrÀhmaõas (VipraÍ Œri-Vatsagotre’bhÂd AhiccÍatrapure purÀ).

It appears that ŒakaÚbhari (Sambhar) and Ajayameru (Ajmer) in RÀjasthan became the capital of the ChÀhamÀnas in the 5th century CE. AjayarÀja I, the father of ArõorÀja, built the city of Ajayameru and their state ‘Ananta’ later became known as SapÀdalakœa. According to the second PariœiÈÇa or Appendix II of the Prabandhakoœa written by Rajaœekhara SÂri, Vasudeva was the earliest king of ChÀhamÀnas and flourished in KV 608 (111 BCE). The PrithvirÀja-Vijaya mentions that VÀsudeva received the gift of the Salt Lake of Sambhar from VidyÀdhara.\n211 The genealogy of the ŒakaÚbhari ChÀhamÀnas given in Prabandhakoœa: ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) In CE 1.

It is evident from the above that the Bijolia inscription and Jain sources (Prabandhakoœa and HammÁra-MahÀkÀvya) give two different genealogies of the ChÀhamÀnas. Historians ignorant of the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719 BCE) synthesised these two different genealogies from different eras into one genealogy leading to many inconsistencies in the history of the ChÀhamÀnas of ŒakaÚbhari. Actually, the Bijolia inscription gives the genealogy of the ChÀhamÀnas of AhiccÍatrapura from the 1st to 6th centuries CE whereas Jain sources (Prabandhakoœa and HammÁra-MahÀkÀvya) give the genealogy of the ChÀhamÀnas of ŒakaÚbhari from the 8th to 13 centuries CE. RaõasthaÚbha or Raõathambor became the capital of the ChÀhamÀnas after the 12th century CE. Many Indian literary sources like PrithvirÀja-Vijaya, PrithvirÀja RÀso, HammÁra-MahÀkÀvya, DvyÀœrayakÀvya, Prabandhakoœa, Prabandha CintÀmaõi, Viruddha Vidhi Viddhvaôsa, Praœasti KÀvyas and other Jaina sources provide substantial historical information about the ChÀhamÀna kings. Since Indians forgot the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 BCE), Western historians followed only one epoch that of the Vikrama era (57 BCE) to reckon the dates mentioned in literary and epigraphic sources. Later Jaina authors of the 14th and 15th centuries also followed only one epoch that of the Vikrama era (57 BCE). This flawed, inaccurate approach of Jaina scholars and Western historians has created many complications in the comprehension of historical facts recorded in Indian literary sources. For instance, Western historians wrongly assumed that the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya of JayÀnaka is all about the Chauhan king PrithvirÀja V who fought Mohammad Ghori in 1191 CE.\n213 The manuscript of the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya, written in the ancient ŒÀradÀ script on birch bark leaves, was found in 1875 and was probably written by the Kashmiri Pandit JayÀnaka who was also in court of the ChÀhamÀna king PrithvirÀja III at Ajayameru (Ajmer). There were five PrithvirÀjas in the genealogy of the ChÀhamÀnas of ŒakaÚbhari. According to the Bijolia inscription and the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya, three PrithvirÀjas flourished around the 5th and 6th centuries CE whereas two other PrithvirÀjas mentioned in the Prabandhakoœa and the HammÁra- MahÀkÀvya reigned in the 11th and 12th centuries CE. Actually, the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya was written about the PrithvirÀja III who flourished around 507-556 CE. Historians mistakenly identified PrithvirÀja V (1179- 1191 CE) to be the hero of the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya. 1. According to the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya, KarpÂradevi was the mother of PrithvirÀja III and the daughter of King Achala of the Haihaya dynasty who ruled at Tripuri. We also learn from Col. James Tod that Rukadevi, the daughter of AnaôgapÀla of Delhi, was the mother of a PrithvirÀja. The HammÁra-MahÀkÀvya also mentions that KarpÂradevi was the mother of PrithvirÀja. Probably, PrithvirÀja III (507-556 CE) was the son of KarpÂradevi, the daughter of the Chedi king Achala of Tripuri whereas PrithvirÀja V (1179-1191 CE) was the son of Rukadevi (or KamalÀvati), the daughter of the Tomara king AnaôgapÀla of Delhi. 2. The Bijolia inscription tells us that the ChÀhamÀna king VigraharÀja III conquered Delhi (DhillikÀ). But PrithvirÀja RÀso mentions that Someœvara led his army to help AnaôgapÀla of Delhi because he was the son-in-law of the Tomara king AnaôgapÀla. It is quite absurd to believe that VigraharÀja III defeated the father-in-law of his elder brother. 3. Actually, the Bijolia inscription is dated in KV 1226 (507 CE). Therefore, the Bijolia inscription and the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya undoubtedly refer only to PrithvirÀja III and not PrithvirÀja V. 4. The PrithvirÀja RÀso of Chandra Bardai tells us of the story of PrithvirÀja having eloped with SaÚyuktÀ or SaÚyogitÀ, the daughter of the Kanauj king Jayachandra. Abul Fazl of Ain-e- THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n214 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Akbari and Chandraœekhara of Surjanacharita also narrate this story. According to the PrithvirÀja RÀso, VijayapÀla was the father of Jayachandra. We learn from the Basahi plates95 of RÀjaputra Govindachandra that his father MadanapÀla was ruling in KV 1161(443 CE) and his grandfather was Chandradeva. MadanapÀla was referred to as Madanachandra in the SÀranÀth inscription96 of KumÀradevi. Jayachandra was the son of Vijayachandra or VijayapÀla and the grandson of Govindachandra. The ChandrÀvati plates97 of Chandradeva dated in KV 1148 (430-431 CE), 1150 (432-433 CE), 1156 (443- 444 CE) tell us that Chandradeva established the GÀhadwÀla kingdom in Kanauj around 430 CE.

Hariœchandra 1245-1277 527-558 CE The Machlisahar grant98 dated in KV 1253 (534 CE) refers to the GÀhadwÀla king Harœchandra, the son of Jayachandra, as a sovereign victorious ruler (ParamabhaÇÇÀraka-MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja- Parama-mÀheœvara........Œrimad-Hariœchandradevo VijayÁ). Had Mohammad Ghori defeated Jayachandra in the battle of Chandawar in 1193 CE, then Hariœchandra cannot claim to be a victorious sovereign ruler. Interestingly, Hariœchandra does not mention the war with Muslim invaders in which his father was\n215 killed. In reality, the GÀhadwÀla kings ruled Kanauj and VÀrÀõasi in 5th and 6th centuries CE and not in the 11th and 12th centuries CE. Alberuni records that Kanauj city was in ruins and found desolate around 1031 CE and that the capital had been transferred thence to the city of Bari, east of the Ganges and there was a distance of three or four days’ marches between the two towns i.e. Kanauj and Bari.99 Kanauj completely lost its glory during the invasions of Mahmud Gazni and therefore, it is unbelievable that a powerful GÀhadwÀla kingdom existed in North India around the 11th and 12th centuries CE. Undoubtedly, Mohammad Ghori defeated a petty king of Kanauj in 1193 CE and not the famous GÀhadwÀla king Jayachandra. Therefore, the story of SaÚyogitÀ and PrithvirÀja and the conflict between ChÀhamÀnas and GÀhadwÀlas was probably all about PrithvirÀja III of the 6th century CE and not PrithvirÀja V of the 12th century CE. 5. According to Muslim chroniclers, Moinuddin Chishti came to Ajmer and got engaged in a conflict with the ruler and people of Ajmer prior to the Turk conquest. JayÀnaka of PrithvirÀja- Vijaya, the court poet of PrithvirÀja III, had no knowledge of this conflict. 6. The PrithvirÀja-Vijaya mentions that DurlabharÀja lost his life in a battle with the MÀtaôgas and AjayarÀja defeated the Garjana MÀtaôgas. It is also stated in the 6th Sarga of PrithvirÀja-Vijaya that ArõorÀja, the grandfather of PrithvirÀja III, defeated and killed the large number of TuruÈkas in heavy armour near Ajmer who had come through the desert, where for want of water they had to drink the blood of horses. ArõorÀja constructed a lake named Ana Sagar in celebration of this great victory. According to the fragmentary Chauhan Praœasti of Ajmer Museum, ArõorÀja killed TuruÈkas near Ajmer and defeated Naravarman of MÀlava and led his army up to the Sindhu and the Sarasvati.100 Historians concocted the fallacy that the MÀtaôgas and TuruÈkas means Muslims and that Garjana means Ghazni. The MÀtaôgas and TuruÈkas were referred to as MleccÍas in ancient Indian literature. Kalhaõa of RÀjataraôgiõÁ THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n216 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA mentions that HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka were TuruÈkas. The TuruÈkas and MÀtaôgas were in existence in the Western borders of ancient India much before the birth of Islam. 7. According to the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya, Someœvara died when PrithvirÀja III was a minor. His mother KarpÂradevi had to take over the reins as regent and ruled with the help of the minister Kadambavasa and the general Bhuvanaikamalla. During the reign of PrithvirÀja III, a king of the MleccÍas captured Garjani in the North-west border; on hearing that Prithviraja had vowed to exterminate the Mlecchas, the MleccÍa king sent a messenger to Ajayameru and we learn from the 11th Sarga that the minister Kadambavasa played an intelligent move in this regard and ultimately, the king of Gujarat completely routs the army of the MleccÍas. Historians mistakenly identified the MleccÍa king with Mohammad Ghori. 8. There is a story of SamarasiÚha of Mewar having been killed in a battle fought in KV 1249 (530 CE) while helping PrithvirÀja III. SamarasiÚha of Mewar was the brother-in-law of PrithvirÀja III. The Jalor stone inscriptions101 of SamarasiÚha are dated in KV 1239 (520 CE) and KV 1242 (523 CE). 9. The manuscript of PrithvirÀja-Vijaya is found written in the ancient ŒÀradÀ script. There is no evidence to prove that the use of the ancient ŒÀradÀ script was in vogue in the 12th century CE. Thus, PrithvirÀja-Vijaya of JayÀnaka is all about the great victories of PrithvirÀja III who flourished as “Bharateœvara” (the emperor of India) in the 6th century CE. Historians mistakenly identified the hero of the PrithvirÀja-Vijaya with PrithvirÀja V of the 12th century CE. There is a serious need for further research to classify the historical information of the ChÀhamÀnas given in various sources with reference to the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). The ChÀhamÀnas of Marwar Inscriptions of the ChÀhamÀnas of Marwar are also dated from KV 1147 (428 CE) to KV 1353 (634 CE).102 This branch of the ChÀhamÀnas ruled over Naççula (Nadol) and JÀbÀlipura (Jalor) in Rajasthan.\n217 The chronology of the ChÀhamÀnas of Marwar: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE 1.

The genealogy of the Satyapura branch of ChÀhamÀnas: Salha (Son of Œobhita) VikramasiÚha SaÚgrÀmasiÚha PratÀpasiÚha THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n218 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Interestingly, the Kot Solankian inscription104 of Vanavira is dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1394 (1337 CE) and the Nadlai inscription105 of Raõavira is dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1443 (1386 CE). These inscriptions express the era as “Œri-nÃpa-Vikrama-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvat” or “Œri-nÃpa-Vikrama- samayÀtÁta-saÚvat” which was probably used to distinguish the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era from the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. Thus, the ChÀhamÀna King Vanavira ruled around 1337 CE and King Raõavira ruled around 1386 CE. The ChandrÀtreyas or Chandellas The Chandella dynasty was one of the glorious royal dynasties of North India. They claimed to be descendants of Rishi ChandrÀtreya and belonged to ChandravaÚœa. The territory occupied by Chandella kings was called JejÀbhukti or JejÀkabhukti (°-KÀlaðjaramÀ ca MÀlavanadÁ- tÁrasthite bhÀsvataÍ, KÀlindisaritaÍ tatÀdita ito’pyÀ-ChedideœÀvadheÍ |) which is now modern Bundelkhand. Probably, Jayaœakti and Vijayaœakti were the first independent rulers of the Chandella dynasty and they were called JejjÀka and VijjÀka. The word JejjÀkabhukti means the kingdom of Jayaœakti. Their earliest capital was KharjÂravÀhaka or Khajuraho and sometime later the capital was shifted to Mahotsavanagara or Mahoba. The earliest king of the Chandellas mentioned in their genealogy is Nannuka. It appears that the Chandellas were initially the feudatories of the PratÁhÀra kings but later they established their independent kingdom. The inscriptions of the Chandellas are dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). The Khajuraho inscription106 of the 8th Chandella king DhÀôga gives the earliest recorded date as KV 1011 (292 CE) and the latest date known from the Charkhari grant of last the Chandella king HammÁravarmadeva is KV 1346 (627 CE). HammÁravarma ruled at least till KV 1368 (649 CE).107 The chronology of the Chandella kings: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era(719-718 BCE) In CE 1. Nannuka 810-835 91-116 CE 2. VÀkpati 835-860 116-141 CE 3.

It is also stated in the Banaras grant that Kokalla I gave protection to Sri Harsha, the king of ChitrakÂÇa who was none other than the Chandella King RÀhila’s son Sri Harsha. Thus, Sri Harsha was a contemporary of the Kalachuri king Kokalla I. The Chandella Sri Harsha was married to a princess of the ChÀhamÀna dynasty. His son Yaœovarman probably married a GÀndhÀra princess.\n220 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA DhÀôga, the son of Yaœovarman, was the illustrious king of the Chandellas. He ruled for at least 50 years. According to one Mahoba inscription, DhÀôga defeated Hamvira. Historians distorted that Hamvira is a sanskritised form of Amir and that Amir was the same as to Gazani ruler Subuktigin (977-997 CE). Actually, DhÀôga was ruling at the beginning of the 4th century and Hamvira was a contemporary Indian king. The Mau inscription of Madanavarman tells us that DhÀôga defeated the king of KÀnyakubja and established his empire (YaÍ KÀnyakubjam narendram samarabhuvi vijitya prÀpa sÀmrÀjyamuccaiÍ).109 He\n221 THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA quite likely defeated the PratÁhÀra king MahendrapÀla II whose only inscription is dated in KV 1003(284 CE). DhÀôga’s son Gandadeva and grandson VidyÀdhara succeeded him. VidhyÀdhara was one of the illustrious kings of the Chandellas. He was a contemporary of the ParamÀra king Bhoja. The Chandella inscription tells us that he had caused the destruction of the king of KÀnyakubja, and that Bhojadeva and the Kalachuri king were like pupils in front of VidyÀdhara.110 It is recorded in the Dubkund inscription111 of the KaccÍapaghÀta prince VikramasiÚha that Arjuna, the great- grandfather of VikramasiÚha, as a military official of VidyÀdhara, killed the PratÁhÀra king RÀjyapÀla in a fierce battle (Œri- VidyÀdharadevakÀryanirataÍ Œri-RÀjyapÀlam haÇhÀt-kaõÇhÀsthiccÍid- anekabÀõanivahair-hatvÀ mahatyÀhave....). According to Muslim historians, when Mahmud Gazani invaded Kanauj in A.H. 409 (1018 CE), the ruler of Kanauj named Rajbal or Rajpal fled away. Then the Chandella ruler marched against him and punished him for his cowardly conduct. The name of the Chandella ruler has been variously given as Nanda or Bida. Historians identified Nanda as Gançadeva and Rajpal as PratÁhÀra RÀjyapÀla. Some historians identified Bida as VidyÀdhara. It may be noted that VidyÀdhara’s army defeated and killed PratÁhÀra RÀjyapÀla in a war whereas Nanda or Bida punished the petty ruler of Kanauj Rajpal. Moreover, Mahmud attacked Nanda in the month of Tir (June-July) in A.H. 410 (1019 CE) and completely routed him. Historians mistakenly identified Gançadeva or VidyÀdhara as Nanda or Bida. Probably, the later Chandella king Vidhuvarman was a contemporary of Mahmud. According to Firishta, a Chandella ruler joined the confederacy of Indian kings organised by °nandapÀla and fought against Mahmud in 1008 CE. Historians concluded that the Chandella ruler mentioned by Firishta must be either Gançadeva or VidyÀdhara but there is no such reference to it in the Chandella inscriptions. Gançadeva and VidhyÀdhara flourished in the 4th century and cannot be contemporaries of Mahmud Gazani. VijayapÀla succeeded his father VidyÀdhara and probably was the contemporary of the Chedi king GÀôgeyadeva. He had two sons, Devavarman and KÁrtivarman.\n222 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Initially, KÁrtivarman suffered defeat but later with the help of his feudatory or minister GopÀla, he defeated the Chedi king Karõa and restored the authority of the Chandellas. Madanavarman was the son of Prithvivarman and the grandson of KÁrtivarman. According to the KumÀrapÀlacharita, the Chaulukya king JayasiÚha defeated Madanavarman. Paramardideva, the grandson of Madanavarman succeeded him. According to ParamÀla RÀso, ParamÀla was the Chandella king and ruled around 1165-1203 CE. Historians wrongly identified ParamÀla to be Paramardi. In reality, Paramardi ruled in the beginning of the 6th century CE whereas ParamÀla ruled in the second half of the 12th century CE. The MahobÀkhanda of ParamÀla RÀso gives the genealogy of Chandellas:112 1. Chandravarman 2. Balavarman 3. Paravarman 4. RÂpavarman I 5. Belavarman 6. Gajavarman 7. Jðanavarman 8. JÀnavarman 9. Œaktivarman 10. PÃthuvarman 11. Bhaktavarman 12. Jagatvarman 13. Kilavarman 14. KalyÀõavarman 15. Surajavarman 16. RÂpavarman II 17. Vidhuvarman (Muslim historians referred him as Bida) 18. RÀhilavarman 19. Madanavarman 20. KÁrtivarman 21. ParamÀla 22. Brahmajit, KÀmajit, Raõajit, Sabhajit or Samarajit. As quoted by RK Dikshit in his book “Candellas of Jejjakabhukti”, Crooks refers to another tradition which states that there were 49 rulers between Chandravarman and ParamÀla. Evidently, the genealogy of the Chandellas given by ParamÀla RÀso is completely different from the genealogy given in the inscriptions. According to the Batesvar inscription113 dated in KV 1252 (533 CE), Paramardi was the son of Yaœovarman whereas ParamÀla was the son of KÁrtivarman. The Madanpur inscription and JinapÀla’s KharatagaccÍa PaÇÇÀvali state that the ChÀhamÀna king PrithvirÀja III (507-556 CE) defeated Paramardi of JejÀkabhukti in KV 1239 (520 CE) whereas PrithvirÀja RÀso informs us that Prithviraj Chauhan (PrithvirÀja V) defeated ParamÀla in CV 1241(1182 CE). The Garra grant tells us that Trailokyavarman, the son of Paramardi, was ruling in KV 1261(542 CE) whereas ParamÀla RÀso records that Brahmajit, KÀmajit, Raõajit, Sabhajit or Samarajit were the sons of Paramala. It is evident that the inscriptions dated in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) tell us the history of the Chandellas from the\n223 THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA 2nd century CE to the middle of the 7th century CE whereas ParamÀla RÀso records the history of the Chandellas from the 8th century CE to the 12th century CE. According to the Duhreti grant114 and two Rewa grants,115 the Kalachuri King Trailokyamalla ruled over the kingdom of KÀnyakubja and Trikaliôga from Kalachuri year 963 (560 CE) to KV 1298 (579 CE). It may be noted that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403 BCE. Since historians knew only one epoch of the Vikrama era that commenced in 57 BCE, they have to fix the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era in 248 or 249 CE. Interestingly, historians concocted the myth that Kalachuri Trailokyamalla of the Duhreti grant was identical to the Chandella Trailokyavarman of the Garra grant. Cunningham speculated that the titles of Chedi princes, including the reference to VÀmadeva, were simply transferred to a Chandella prince. There is not an iota of evidence to prove the Kalachuri Trailokyamalla was the same as Chandella Trailokyavarman. In fact, both were contemporary kings and the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla was ruling in KÀnyakubja around 560- 578 CE whereas the Chandella king Trailokyavarman was ruling in KÀlinjar around 542-575 CE. VÁravarman, the son of Trailokyavarman succeeded him. An unpublished Mathura museum plate116 dated in KV 1334 (615 CE) was issued by PratÁhÀra AjayapÀla, a feudatory of VÁravarman. Fifteen inscriptions found in the Bangla village of Shivapuri Dist., Madhya Pradesh inform us about a fierce battle fought between the YajvapÀla king GopÀla and VÁravarman.117 It seems that VÁravarman, along with four other kings attacked GopÀla in KV 1337 (618 CE). The Narwar inscription118 dated in KV 1339 (620 CE) records that GopÀla defeated VÁravarman. VÁravarman has two sons, Bhojavarman and HammÁravarman. Bhojavarman ruled for a short period. According to some inscriptions, HammÁravarman was ruling around KV 1368 (649 CE). A damaged stone inscription119 tells us that VÁravarman II was ruling in KV 1368 (649 CE). It is well known that Qutbuddin Aibak comprehensively defeated the Chandellas and conquered the fort of KÀlinjar in 1203 CE. He appointed Hasan Arnal as governor of KÀlinjar. A Persian historian\n224 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Minhaj-us-Siraj mentions in his Tabqat-e-Nasiri that Malik Nusratuddin Tayasi led an army from Gwalior towards KÀlinjar in the year A.H. 631 (1233 CE) but the king of KÀlinjar fled away. Tabqat-e-Nasiri also tells us that a RÀõÀ named Dalaki wa Malaki was ruling in a mountainous region not far from Kaça (Allahabad Dist.) which was raided by Ulugh Khan (Balban) in A.H. 645 (1247 CE). Firishta also records that Dalaki wa Malaki (early Baghel kings Dalakesvar and Malakesvar) resided at KÀlinjar. It is also recorded in the Muslim accounts that the Delhi Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud (1246-1266 CE) subjugated Bundelkhand and appointed his governor around 1250 CE. He was also controlling the regions of Gwalior, Chanderi and MÀlava. Alauddin Khilji was the most powerful ruler of entire North India during 1296-1316 CE. If one were to accept that the Chandella inscriptions were dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 CE) as believed by eminent historians, it would be impossible for Trailokyavarman, VÁravarman, Bhojavarman and HammÁravarman to have proclaimed themselves as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and KÀliðjarÀdhipati from 1204 CE to 1311 CE. If Trailokyavarman had defeated the Muslim governor and re-established the Chandella kingdom in 1204 CE, it must have been the greatest achievement of the Chandellas. ParamÀla Raso tells us that Paramala’s eldest son Brahmajit died fighting the army of Prithviraj Chauhan but does not provide any information about the great achievements of Trailokyavarman. It would also have been impossible for VÁravarman to have a PratÁhÀra AjayapÀla as feudatory. In fact, the Chandella kings Trailokyavarman to HammÁravarman flourished from 542 CE to 649 CE and their inscriptions are dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). Therefore, a later king ParamÀla was ruling at KÀlinjar during the reign of Qutbuddin who lost his fort in 1203 CE. It is likely that one son of Paramala may have agreed to pay tribute to Delhi and continued to hold the fort of KÀlinjar. It appears that he may have revolted or failed to pay tribute in 1233 CE and had to face the invasion of Malik Nusratuddin Tayasi. Ultimately, he had to leave the fort of KÀlinjar and the glorious Chandella dynasty ended in 1233 CE. Probably the Baghel kings Dalakesvar and Malakesvar annexed KÀlinjar fort after 1233 CE but lost to Ulugh Khan in 1247 CE.\n225 THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA The KaccÍapaghÀtas The Dubkund inscription120 of VikramasiÚha dated in KV 1145 (426 CE) is the earliest available source of information about the dynasty of KaccÍapaghÀta. It seems that the KaccÍapaghÀtas were the military officials of the Chandellas and Arjuna was likely the commander-in- chief of the Chandella king VidyÀdhara. Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, became the feudatory of ParamÀra Bhoja. They were ruling in the region of Gwalior. The genealogy of KaccÍapaghÀtas: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE 1. YuvarÀja — — 2. Arjuna 1060-1090 341-371 CE 3. Abhimanyu 1090-1100 371-381 CE 4. VijayapÀla 1100-1130 381-411 CE 5. VikramasiÚha 1130-1145 411-426 CE Interestingly, two Gwalior stone inscriptions121 of MahipÀla dated in CV 1150 (1093 CE) and CV 1161(1104 CE) indicate that the KaccÍapaghÀtas were independent rulers of the Gwalior region in the 10th and 11th centuries CE. Historians wrongly concluded that MahipÀla and VikramasiÚha were contemporaries and belonged to two different families. Evidently, VikramasiÚha of the Dubkund inscription was the descendant of a feudatory family of the KaccÍapaghÀtas whereas MahipÀla was the descendant of a family of sovereign kings of KaccÍapaghÀtas. According to MahipÀla’s inscriptions, his ancestor VajradÀman put down the valour of the ruler of GÀdhinagara and his great-grandfather KÁrtirÀja defeated the king of MÀlava. Historians mistakenly identified the king of MÀlava with the ParamÀra king Bhoja. VikramasiÚha proudly tells us that his grandfather Abhimanyu’s valour and skill were highly eulogised by the MÀlava king Bhoja. In fact, the inscription of VikramasiÚha is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 CE) whereas the inscriptions of MahipÀla are dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE).Therefore, VikramasiÚha and MahipÀla cannot be contemporaries. MahipÀla was ruling at GopÀdri (Gwalior) in the 11th century whereas VikramasiÚha flourished in the 5th century CE.\n226 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The KaccÍapaghÀta king KÁrtirÀja may have defeated a MÀlava king of the 10th century CE.

Evidently, another branch of the KaccÍapaghÀta dynasty was ruling at Nalapura (Narwar) in the 11th century and they bore the titles of MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja, Parameœvara and ParamabhaÇÇÀraka. The genealogy of the Nalapura family of the KaccÍapaghÀtas: ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) In CE 1. GaganasiÚha 1100-1130 1043-1073 CE 2. ŒaradasiÚha 1130-1160 1073-1103 CE 3. VÁrasiÚha 1160-1177 1103-1120 CE The YajvapÀlas Some inscriptions found in Narwar in the Shivpuri District of Madhya Pradesh tell us that the YajvapÀla or Jejjapella dynasty was ruling in the 6th and 7th centuries CE. They also used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era in their inscriptions. The earliest inscription123 of this dynasty is dated in KV 1319 (600 CE) which was engraved on stone during the reign of °salladeva. One inscription at Narwar mentions that the YajvapÀla king Nrivarman forced the king of DhÀrÀ to pay tribute to\n227 him (paribhÂya yena DhÀrÀdhipÀdapi karo jagÃhe’tidÃptÀt).124 It is probable that Jayavarman II of the ParamÀra dynasty was the king of DhÀrÀ who paid tribute to YajvapÀla king Nrivarman. GopÀla was an illustrious king of this dynasty who claimed his victory over the Chandella King VÁravarman I around KV 1337-1338 (618-619 CE).125 GopÀla’s son Gaõapati conquered the KÁrtidurga (ÀdÀya KÁrtidurgam) around KV 1351 (632 CE).126 KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE 1. YaramÀdi or ParamÀdi — — 2. ChÀhada 1290-1311 571-592 CE 3. Nrivarman 1311-1319 592-600 CE 4. °salladeva 1319-1335 600-616 CE 5. GopÀla 1335-1350 616-631 CE 6. Gaõapati 1350-1360 631-641 CE One inscription of the YajvapÀla king Gaõapati is dated in KV 1351(632-633 CE) and Œaka 1216 (633 CE) which is also evidence that YajvapÀlas used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era.127 If indeed the YajvapÀlas had reigned in the 13th century CE, it would have been impossible for Nrivarman to extract the tribute from the king of DhÀrÀ. Qutubuddin Aibak conquered the Gwalior region in 1196 CE and compelled the king to pay tribute. The Gwalior region was firmly under the control of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th and 14th centuries CE. There was absolutely no scope for the YajvapÀlas in the 13th century to be MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀjas and to collect tribute from neighbouring states. The YajvapÀlas, in fact, flourished in the 6th and 7th century CE and not in 13th century CE as believed by historians. The epigraphic evidence of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) Solar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions are the strongest epigraphic evidence to calculate the exact epoch of a particular era. Let us calculate the dates of the solar eclipses given in the inscriptions of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era considering the latitude (23.2) and longitude (75.8) of Ujjain.

Thus, it can be construed that these inscriptions are dated in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). Interestingly, the Pindiwara grant143 of ParamÀra DhÀrÀvarÈa dated in the year 1274 elapsed (556- 557 CE) refers to the occurrence of a lunar eclipse between MÀgha and PhÀlguni nakœatras which corresponds regularly to 30th January 557 CE. This lunar eclipse cannot be explained in the epoch of 57 BCE. Therefore, the chronology of various dynasties as discussed above must be reworked with reference to the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 BCE). We may also have to reconstruct the calendar of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era to work out the exact dates mentioned in these inscriptions. The epoch of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era It is established that the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE but there is a divergence of opinion about the originator of this era. According to Indian tradition, King VikramÀditya of Ujjain was the originator of the Vikrama era. Modern historians are almost convinced that the Scythian king Azes I or the Parthian king Vonones initiated this era in North-Western India which was brought to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh by the MÀlava people. Interestingly, these eminent historians completely reject the existence of a king named VikramÀditya. As a matter of fact, there were two VikramÀdityas who became the kings of Ujjain in ancient times. According to Jaina sources, the Jaina monk KÀlakÀcÀrya brought 96 Œaka Kœatrapas to Ujjain to defeat king Gardabhilla in 723 BCE. Œakas established their rule for the first time in India around 723 BCE and ruled for four years. VikramÀditya I defeated the Œakas in 719-718 BCE and founded the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. Gardabhilla was likely a feudatory king of the ŒÀtavÀhanas. VikramÀditya I established an independent MÀlava-gaõa empire and ruled for 60 years from 719-718 BCE to 659-658 BCE. An inscription at Udayagiri (Cave No. 9) dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama 1093 (345 CE) tells us that Chandragupta II (278-242 BCE) constructed this cave temple after THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n234 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the reign of VikramÀditya.144 VikramÀditya became one of the most celebrated kings of ancient India and his era came into use in North India. This KÀrttikÀdi era was initially referred as “KÃta” or “MÀlava- gaõa” but later it was referred as “SaÚvat” or “Sri-VikramÀdityotpÀdita- saÚvatsara”, etc. According to the BhaviÈya PurÀõa, another VikramÀditya was born in the Kaliyuga era 3000 elapsed (101 BCE) and his father was Gandharvasena. When he was five years old, VikramÀditya went to the Aœramas of Rishis in the forest to be educated and studied there for 12 years. Thereafter, VikramÀditya returned to the city of AmbÀvati and he was anointed king on a golden throne decorated with 32 golden idols. “PÂrõe triÚœatccÍate varÈe Kalau prÀpte bhayaôkare|| ŒakÀnÀm ca vinÀœÀrtham Àrya-dharma-vivÃddhaye | JÀtaœœivÀjðayÀ so’pi KailÀsÀt GuhyakÀlayÀt || VikramÀditya-nÀmÀnam PitÀ kÃtvÀ mumoda ha | Sa bÀlo’pi mahÀprÀjðaÍ pitÃ-matÃ-priyaÚkaraÍ|| Paðcha-varÈe vayaÍ prÀpte tapasÀrthe vanam gataÍ| DvÀdaœÀbdam prayatnena Vikrameõa KÃtam tapaÍ|| PaœcÀd-ambÀvatÁm divyam purÁm yÀtaÍ œriyÀnvitaÍ| divyam siÚhÀsanam ramyam dvÀtriÚœan mÂrti-saÚyutam|| ”145 VikramÀditya II was probably coronated at AmbÀvati around 82 BCE. According to the PurÀõas, he belonged to the ParamÀra dynasty. Pramara, the progenitor of the ParamÀra dynasty, established a kingdom in Avanti around Kaliyuga era 2710 (392 BCE) and also founded his capital in the city named AmbÀvati (AmarÀvati in Vidarbha, Maharashtra. The famous AmbÀdevi temple is situated in this city.). He ruled for 6 years. “°vante PramÀro bhÂpaœcÀturyo janavistÃtam | AmabÀvatÁ nÀma purÁmadhyÀsya sukhito’bhavat|| ”146 “SaptaviÚœatiœate varÈe daœÀbde cÀdhike kalau | Pramaro nÀma bhÂpÀlaÍ kÃtam rÀjyam ca ÈatsamÀÍ|| ”147 After PramÀra, MahÀmÀra, DevÀpi and DevadÂta ruled for 9 years (3 years each). Then the ParamÀras migrated to Œriœailam probably due to the invasion of the Œakas. After a lapse of two centuries, Gandharvasena I, Œaôkha MahÀrÀja and Gandharvasena II became kings\n235 of a smaller kingdom. VikramÀditya was the second son of Gandharvasena II. It seems that VikramÀditya successfully established a powerful empire between 80 BCE and 60 BCE and made Ujjayini as his capital. Kalhaõa of RÀjataraôgiõi refers to him as “EkaccÍatra ChakravartÁ” and mentions that he was also known as Harsha. “TatrÀnehasyujjayinyÀm ŒrimÀn HarshaparÀbhidhaÍ| EkaccÍatraœchchakravarti VikramÀditya ityabhÂt|| ”148 SÀgaranandin of Natakaratnakoœa also referred him as King Sri- Harsshavikrama. “Sri-Harshavikrama-narÀdhipa-MÀtÃgupta GargÀœmakutta-Nakhakuttaka-BÀdarÀõÀm |”149 We learn from Kalhaõa’s RÀjataraôgiõÁ that when the king of Kashmir Hiraõya died issueless, the ministers reported the matter to their emperor VikramÀditya of Ujjain also known as Harsha that a successor may be nominated. VikramÀditya contemplated a whole night as to who should be a proper person to sit on the throne of Kashmir and pitched his mind upon MÀtÃgupta, the learned poet and administrator as the right candidate. The next day, he dispatched messengers to the minister of Kashmir and at the same time gave a sealed order to MÀtÃgupta addressed to the ministers of Kashmir enjoining him to deliver it to the ministers without breaking open the sealed order. MÀtÃgupta fulfilled the emperor’s injunction. The ministers opened the order and questioned MÀtÃgupta if the person named in the order was him, to which MÀtÃgupta replied in the affirmative and was thus proclaimed as the king of Kashmir.150 But there are serious errors in the chronology of VikramÀditya and MÀtÃgupta as given by Kalhaõa. Actually, this incident appears to have taken place either in the last or penultimate decade of the 1st century BCE. According to the PurÀõas, VikramÀditya lived for 100 years (probably, 101 BCE to 1 BCE). Kalhaõa tells us that when the news of VikramÀditya’s death reached him, MÀtÃgupta took it to heart and renounced the world. HariswÀmi, who wrote a commentary named “ŒrutyarthavivÃti” on Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa mentions the king of Ujjain, VikramÀditya THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n236 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA (Œrimato’vantinÀthasya VikramÀrkasya bhÂpateÍ)151 held the offices of “DharmÀdhyakœa” and “DÀnÀdhyakœa” in the court of VikramÀditya, the king of Avanti and was the son of NÀgaswÀmi and a resident of Pushkar in Rajasthan. The famous Sanskrit poet KÀlidÀsa was in the court of VikramÀditya. He wrote JyotirvidÀbharaõa on astronomy in Kaliyuga era 3068 (33 BCE) and dedicated it to King VikramÀditya. He called himself as “nÃpasakhÀ” which indicates that he belonged to the same age group of king VikramÀditya. “ŒaôkvÀdi-panditavarÀÍ kavayastvaneke jyotirvidaœca prabhavaôœca VarÀhapÂrvÀÍ| Œri-VikramÀrka-nÃpa-saÚsadi mÀnyabuddhiÍ tairapyaham nÃpasakhÀ kila KÀlidÀsaÍ|| ”152 VikramÀditya fought the Œakas in the North-western region and killed a Œaka king of the province “Rummakeœa” as recorded in KÀlidÀsa’s JyotirvidÀbharaõa. “Yo RummakeœÀdhipatim Œakeœvaram jitvÀ gÃhito’jjayinÁm mahÀhave| °nÁya saÚbhrÀmya mumoca tam tvaho Œri-VikramÀrka-samasahyavikramaÍ|| ”153 Alberuni also mentions that VikramÀditya marched against a Œaka king and killed him in the region of Karur, between Multan and the castle of Loni.154 This incident ought to have taken place around 57 BCE. Interestingly, KÀlidÀsa compares the outstanding irresistible valour of his friend, the king VikramÀditya with that of another king, Œri- VikramÀrka (Œri-VikramÀrka-sama-sahya-vikramaÍ) who existed before king VikramÀditya of the 1st century BCE. Therefore, two VikramÀdityas became kings of Ujjain. VikramÀditya I flourished in the city of Ujjain of MÀlava around 719-659 BCE and was referred to as “MÀlaveœa” means the king of MÀlava GaõarÀjya whereas VikramÀditya II flourished in the city of Ujjain of Avanti around 82-10 BCE and was referred to as “AvantinÀtha” means the lord of Avanti. Interestingly, both VikramÀdityas successfully fought against the Œakas. VikramÀditya I became the sovereign ruler of MÀlava by defeating\n237 96 Œaka Kœatraps brought by the Jaina monk KÀlakÀcÀrya in 719-718 BCE when the ŒÀtavÀhanas were ruling in Magadha and DakœiõÀpatha. It appears that VikramÀditya I’s empire was limited to MÀlava and North western India while VikramÀditya II established a greater kingdom in Central and Northern India. According to KÀlidÀsa’s JyotirvidÀbharaõa, VikramÀditya conquered Draviça, LÀÇa, Vaôga, Gauda, Gurjara, DhÀrÀ and KÀmboja. Undoubtedly, VikramÀditya II was a contemporary of the early Chalukya Pulakeœin II. VikramÀditya II lost control over Draviça (°ndhra and Chola kingdom) during the conflict between him and Pulakeœin II. It seems that Harsha was the original name of VikramÀditya II as referred to by Kalhaõa of RÀjataraôgiõÁ and SÀgaranandin of NÀtakaratnakoœa. VikramÀditya was either his regnal name or the title attained after he killed a Œaka king of Rummakeœa. Pulakeœin II claimed victory over Harsha, the lord of UttarÀpatha, in his copper plate grants. Undoubtedly, the “Harsha”, “Sri Harsha”, “Harshavardhana”, etc. mentioned in the early Chalukya grants were none other than VikramÀditya II and the war between Harsha (VikramÀditya II) and Pulakeœin II occurred prior to 53 BCE.155 VikramÀditya II sent KÀlidÀsa as his emissary to the court of Kuntaleœvara i.e. Pulakeœin II after his defeat. KÀlidÀsa beautifully narrates his experience as emissary in his work “Kuntaleœvaradautyam” which is unfortunately now lost. Historians concocted the fable that Pulakeœin II was a contemporary of Harshavardhana of Kanauj but Harshavardhana flourished around 457 BCE. As discussed in",

    "content": ", Pulakeœin II ruled around 52-22 BCE considering the epoch of Œaka era in 583 BCE. It can be concluded that two VikramÀdityas flourished as kings of Ujjain, one in the 8th century BCE and the other in the 1st century BCE. VikramÀditya I founded a KÀrttikÀdi era in 719-718 BCE which was referred to as “KÃta”, “MÀlava-gaõa”, “Vikrama” or “SaÚvat” in the inscriptions and this era became popular in North India. The earliest inscription156 referring to the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era is dated in 282 (437 BCE) and the last inscription157 is dated in 1689 (970 CE). Another epoch of the Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE and it followed the ChaitrÀdi calendar. It is logical to infer that this ChaitrÀdi era was not introduced by VikramÀditya II. It appears that Indian astronomers introduced this THE EPOCH OF THE KÃTA, MÀLAVA-GAÕA AND VIKRAMA ERA\n238 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA \u0002 era with an objective to switch over from the KÀrttikÀdi calendar to the ChaitrÀdi calendar around the 2ndcentury CE and later, linked it to the historical event of the killing of the Œaka king of Rummakeœa by VikramÀditya II. Another group of Indian astronomers wanted to reset the epoch of Œaka era for accurate astronomical calculations. Accordingly, Indian astronomers had reset the epoch of the Œaka era in 78 CE around the 2ndcentury CE and linked this epoch to the death of a Œaka king around 78 CE. Thus, the epoch of the Vikrama era was reset from 719-718 BCE to 57 BCE and the epoch of the Œaka era was reset from 583 BCE to 78 CE. Interestingly, the epoch of both eras were brought forward by 661 years. The new Œaka era (later known as ŒÀlivÀhana era), which was linked to the commemoration of the death of a Œaka king, followed the same ChaitrÀdi calendar whereas the new Vikrama era of 57 BCE replaced the KÀrttikÀdi calendar with ChaitrÀdi calendar. This resetting of the epoch happened most likely around 100-200 CE. The earliest inscription158 referring to the ŒÀlivÀhana era is dated in 310 (388 CE). Interestingly, both eras, Œaka (583 BCE) and ŒÀlivÀhana (78 CE) were in vogue and gradually, the epoch of the Œaka era became extinct by the 10th century CE. Though the earliest use of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era is recorded in the year 258 (201 CE), it came into popular use only from the 8th century CE. Nine documents out of the ten recorded in the Ahar inscription159 are dated around 258-298 (201-241 CE) in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era but the next available inscription referring to the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era is dated in 794 (737 CE).160 It is evident that though the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era was introduced in the 2ndcentury CE, it came into the popular use only from the 8th century CE and by the 10th century CE, the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era was forgotten. The KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the Œaka era (583 BCE) were generally not in use by the 9thcentury CE and Indians completely forgot the epoch of these old eras by the 10th century CE. Thus, Alberuni of the 11th century CE could record only the epoch of ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) and ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE).\n239 Sri Harsha was one of the most celebrated kings of India and belonged to the PuÈpabhÂti dynasty, one of the ancient dynasties of North India. According to Indian tradition, Sri Harsha founded an era in 457 BCE. Three grants1 of Sri Harsha are dated in SaÚvat 22 (435 BCE), 23 (434 BCE) and 25 (432 BCE). Alberuni, who came to India around 1017-1031 CE, states that the Sri Harsha era was founded 400 years before the Vikrama era (57 BCE): “The Hindus believe regarding Sri Harsha....... His era is used in Mathura and the country of Kanauj. Between Sri Harsha and VikramÀditya there is an interval of 400 years, as I have been told by some of the inhabitants of that region. However, in the Kashmirian calendar I have read that Sri Harsha was 664 years later than VikramÀditya. In face of this discrepancy I am in perfect uncertainty, which to the present moment has not yet been cleared up by any trustworthy information.” “Now, the year 400 of Yazdajird, which we have chosen as a gauge, corresponds to the following years of the Indian eras: 1. To the year 1488 of the era of Sri Harsha 2. To the year 1088 of the era of VikramÀditya2” It is evident from Alberuni’s account that the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE. He also calculated that the year 1031 CE corresponds to the year 1488 in the Sri Harsha era. He simply stated that according to some Kashmirian sources, one Sri Harsha was ruling 664 years after VikramÀditya. Therefore, Alberuni expressed his inability to explain why the people of Mathura and Kanauj believed the existence of the rule of King Sri Harsha in 457 BCE whereas some Kashmirian sources tell us that Sri Harsha ruled 664 years after VikramÀditya i.e. 606 CE.",

    "content": "The Epoch of the Sri Harsha era and Kalachuri-Chedi era\n240 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA It is clear that some Kashmirian sources simply mention that a king Sri Harsha flourished 664 years after VikramÀditya. There is no mention of Sri Harsha having started an era in 606 CE but Western historians concocted the myth that Sri Harsha was supposed to have started an era from about 606 CE. Thus, historians fixed the time of Sri Harsha around 606-647 CE. Actually, Sri Harsha, the son of PrabhÀkaravardhana flourished around 457 BCE whereas a later king Sri Harsha, the son of Rasal ruled in the 7th century CE. According to Chacha-NÀma, a king named Siharasa, the son of Rasal, was ruling in Kanauj in the 7th century CE during the reign of Chandara, the king of Sindh. Therefore, some Kashmirian sources say that Sri Harsha (the son of Rasal) ruled 664 years after VikramÀditya. Historians, by distorting and misinterpreting these facts, erroneously concluded that Sri Harsha, the son of PrabhÀkaravardhana and Sri Harsha, the son of Rasal were one and the same and created a non- existent era having the epoch of 606 CE. The rulers of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty flourished in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and Sri Harsha was the most illustrious king of this dynasty. Probably, PuÈpabhÂti was the progenitor of this dynasty as mentioned in the Harshacharita of BÀõabhaÇÇa. According to the genealogy given in the grants of Sri Harsha, Naravardhana was the earliest known king of the PuÈpabhÂti dynasty who was succeeded by his son RÀjyavardhana I and subsequently by his grandson °dityavardhana. PrabhÀkaravardhana, the son of °dityavardhana had two sons, RÀjyavardhana II & Sri Harsha and one daughter, RÀjyaœri. The chronology of the PuÈpabhÂti dynasty: In CE 1. Naravardhana 580-550 BCE 2. RÀjyavardhana I 550-520 BCE 3. °dityavardhana 520-500 BCE 4. PrabhÀkaravardhana 500-465 BCE 5. RÀjyavardhana II 465-458 BCE 6. Sri Harsha or Harshavardhana 457-420 BCE\n241 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA PrabhÀkaravardhana was the first sovereign king of the PuÈpabhÂti dynasty as he was referred as “MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja” in the inscriptions. He defeated the HÂõas, the kings of Sindh, GÀndhÀra, Gurjara, LÀÇa and MÀlava as mentioned in Harshacharita. His capital was SthÀõvÁœvara or Thanesar located in Kurukshetra district of Haryana. It seems that the PuÈpabhÂtis had family relations with the MÀlava Guptas. MahÀsenaguptadevi, the mother of PrabhÀkaravardhana, was the daughter of MÀlava Gupta king MahÀsenagupta (MahÀsenaguptadevyÀmutpannaÍ).3 Later, MahÀsenagupta also sent his sons KumÀragupta and MÀdhavagupta to live as companions to the PuÈpabhÂti princes. Historians wrongly called the MÀlava Guptas as the Later Guptas; in reality, their period was prior to the rise of the Imperial Guptas. Therefore, the MÀlava Guptas must be referred to as the Early Guptas. The Aphsad inscription of the MÀlava Gupta king °dityasena, the son of MÀdhavagupta is dated in Sri Harsha era 66 (391 CE).4 The chronology of the Early Guptas (Later Guptas?): In CE Krishnagupta 630-610 BCE Harshagupta 610-590 BCE JÁvitagupta I 590-570 BCE KumÀragupta 570-550 BCE DÀmodaragupta 550-530 BCE MahÀsenagupta 530-480 BCE MÀdhavagupta 480-440 BCE °dityasena 440-390 BCE Devagupta 390-360 BCE Vishõugupta 360-330 BCE JÁvitagupta II 330-300 BCE According to the Harshacharita of BÀõabhaÇÇa, PrabhÀkaravardhana married off his daughter RÀjyaœri to Grahavarman, the son of Avantivarman of Maukhari family of KÀnyakubja. Thus, Maukhari kings became the allies of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty. The MÀlava king had slain\n242 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Grahavarman and imprisoned RÀjyaœri in Kanauj. His elder brother RÀjyavardhana succeeded in defeating the MÀlava king named Devagupta but was probably killed by the king of Gauça. It appears that he was treacherously killed in the camp of enemies as recorded in the inscriptions of Sri Harsha (rÀjÀno yudhi duÈtavÀjina iva Œri- DevaguptÀdayaÍ.......PrÀõÀnujjhitavÀnrÀti-bhavane satyÀnurodhena yaÍ). Certainly, Devagupta cannot be linked to the MahÀsenagupta and °dityasena family of the MÀlava Guptas because they and Maukharis had family relations with PuÈpabhÂtis. Historians mistakenly identified the Gauça king to be King ŒaœÀôka. The Ganjam plates5 of ŒaœÀôka are dated in 35-34 BCE (Gupta era 300) considering the epoch of Gupta era in 335 BCE. Therefore, King ŒaœÀôka of the 1st century BCE cannot be the contemporary of RÀjyavardhana. Some sources even pointed out that there is no record of a battle between RÀjyavardhana and ŒaœÀôka and that the latter took care to avoid a fight with the PuÈpabhÂti king after the defeat of the MÀlava ruler at his hands.6 Harshacharita tells us that the MÀlava king and the Gauça king joined hands to fight against RÀjyavardhana. The MÀlava king is named as Devagupta in inscriptions. One manuscript of the Harshacharita names the Gauça king as Narendragupta.7 The MahÀyÀna Buddhist text °rya- MaðjuœrÁ-MÂla-Kalpa mentions that a certain king “RakÀrÀdyotayuktÀtmÀ” ruled the “Madhyadeœa” and his younger brother “HakÀrÀkhya” also became the king who defeated “SomÀkhya”.8 Historians speculated that RakÀrÀdyotayuktÀtmÀ means RÀjyavardhana, HakÀrÀkhya means Harsha and SomÀkhya means ŒaœÀôka. Actually, °rya-MaðjuœrÁ-MÂla- Kalpa clearly tells us that RakÀrÀdyotayuktÀtmÀ became the king of Madhyadeœa meaning MÀlava kingdom. RÀjyavardhana became the king of SthÀõvÁœvara and Madhyadeœa was not part of his kingdom. In fact, he was in conflict with the MÀlava king Devagupta. Thus, ŒaœÀôka of the Ganjam grant cannot be the Gauça king mentioned in Harshacharita. Most probably the Gauça king was Narendragupta as recorded in one manuscript of Harshacharita. Sri Harsha marched with a strong army to avenge the death of RÀjyavardhana and destroyed the Gauça king. BhÀskaravarman of KÀmarÂpa also became the ally of Sri Harsha. BhÀskaravarman was the most illustrious king of Assam and belonged to the Bhagadatta and\n243 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA PuÈyavarman dynasty. The Aphsad inscription of °dityasena tells us that MahÀsenagupta defeated Susthitavarman, the father of BhÀskaravarman. According to the Nidhanpur copper plates,9 it is said that the kings of the dynasty of Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta and their descendants ruled for 3000 years. Thereafter, PuÈyavarman ascended the throne around 7th century BCE. It must be noted that the KÀmarÂpa (Assam) has an account of its history since 3700 BCE. The genealogy of the KÀmarÂpa kings as given in the Nidhanpur plates: In CE Naraka, Bhagadatta, Vajradatta and their descendants 3700-700 BCE PuÈyavarman 700-690 BCE Samudravarman 690-670 BCE Balavarman 670-660 BCE KalyÀõavarman 660-480 BCE Gaõapati 640-440 BCE Mahendravarman 620-600 BCE NÀrÀyaõavarman 600-580 BCE MahÀbhÂtavarman 580-560 BCE Chandramukhavarman 560-540 BCE Sthitavarman 540-520 BCE Susthitavarman (also known as MrigÀôka) 520-480 BCE SupratiÈÇhitavarman 480-465 BCE BhÀskaravarman 465-420 BCE It seems that Sri Harsha also conquered Nepal. We learn from the Harshacharita of BÀõa that Sri Harsha collected tax from a land of snowy mountains (atra parameœvareõa tuÈÀraœailabhuvo durgÀyÀ gÃhÁtaÍ karaÍ).10 Some inscriptions of the LiccÍavi dynasty of ancient Nepal are dated in the Sri Harsha era. Sri Harsha conquered Nepal during the reign of Œivadeva I and introduced his era in Nepal. The earliest kings of the LiccÍavi dynasty used an unknown era having the epoch in the 10th century BCE (around 966 BCE?). Historians assumed this unknown era\n244 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA to be the Œaka era. It is evident that the LiccÍavi kings followed the KÀrttikÀdi calendar in their inscriptions whereas only the ChaitrÀdi calendar is used in the Œaka era. The inscriptions of LiccÍavis indicate the practice of intercalation of only two months i.e. PauÈa and °ÈÀçha. The PauÈa-°ÈÀçha intercalation was first adopted in Lagadha’s VedÀôga JyotiÈa (1400 BCE). There is no evidence to prove such intercalation in the calendar of the Œaka era. According to the PaÈupati stele inscription11 of Jayadeva II dated in Sri Harsha era 157 (300 BCE), Jayadeva I was the founder of the LiccÍavi dynasty and 11 kings ruled after him. Thereafter, VÃÈadeva, his son Œankaradeva and his grandson Dharmadeva ascended the throne. MÀnadeva was the 16th king and his earliest inscription12 is dated in an unknown (LiccÍavi) era 386 (580 BCE) and the date corresponds regularly to 16th April 580 BCE (SaÚvat 300 80 6 JyeÈÇhamÀse œuklapakœe pratipadi RohiõÁ-nakœatre candramasi muhÂrte praœaste’bhijiti....). Jayadeva I may have founded this unknown era or LiccÍavi era in 966 BCE. The PaÈupati inscription of Jayadeva II tells us that Œivadeva II married Vatsadevi, the daughter of Maukhari king Bhogavarma and the maternal granddaughter of Magadha king °dityasena (Œri BhogavarmodbhavÀ| DauhitrÁ MagadhÀdhipasya mahataÍœryÀdityasenasya yÀ vyÂdhÀ.....). °dityasena belonged to MÀlava Gupta family and his Aphsad inscription is dated in Sri Harsha era 66 (391 BCE). Œivadeva II’s son Jayadeva II married RÀjyamatÁ, the daughter of Sri Harshadeva, the king of Gauça, Ouçra, Kaliôga and Kosala and the descendant of the Bhagadatta royal dynasty (GauçoçrÀdi-Kaliôga-Kosala-pati Œri- HarshadevÀtmajÀ| Devi RÀjyamati kulocitaguõair yuktÀ prabhÂtÀ kulair yenoçhÀ BhagadattarÀjakulajÀ lakœmÁriva kœmÀbhujÀ|). Harshadeva was the descendant of the same lineage of BhÀskaravarman and probably was the grandson of BhÀskaravarman. The genealogy and chronology of the LiccÍavi dynasty can be reconstructed thus:\n245 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA LiccÍavi era Sri Harsha In CE (966 BCE) era (457 BCE) Jayadeva I — — 966 BCE? 11 unnamed kings — — Vrishadeva — — 950-580 BCE?

Interestingly, BÀõabhaÇÇa mentions BÃhatkathÀ of GuõÀçhya, GÀthÀsaptaœatÁ of HÀla ŒÀtavÀhana, VÀsavadattÀ of Subandhu, Setubandha of Pravarasena, Harichandra, BhÀsa and KÀlidÀsa.13 KÀlidÀsa flourished in the 1st century BCE as discussed in",

Thus, the date of BÀõabhaÇÇa cannot be fixed prior to the 1st century BCE and he cannot be a contemporary of King Sri Harsha of the 5th century BCE. Historians misunderstood the second chapter “RÀjadarœana” of Harshacharita in which BÀõabhaÇÇa narrates his meeting with the King Sri Harsha. BÀõabhaÇÇa tells us that he was invited by Krishna, the brother of King Sri Harsha (MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja-Œri-Harshasya bhrÀtrÀ KÃÈõanÀmnÀ.....).14 He crossed the GaôgÀ River and reached the capital city named Upamaõipura where the royal palace was situated (anyasmin dine skandhÀvÀramupamaõipuram anvajiravati kÃtasanniveœam samÀsasÀda| [Upamaõipuram nagara nÀma]).15 But Sri Harsha’s brother was RÀjyavardhana, not Krishna and his capital was SthÀõvÁœvara or KÀnyakubja, not Upamaõipura. It is evident that BÀõabhaÇÇa met a later king Sri Harsha of Upamaõipura and not the Sri Harsha of SthÀõvÁœvara or KÀnyakubja. In all likelihood, BÀõabhaÇÇa was the court poet of Sri Harsha of the 1st century CE who was defeated by the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa Dantidurga (KÀðchÁœa- Kerala-narÀdhipa-Chola-PÀõçya Sri Harsha-VajraÇa-vibheda-vidhÀna- dakœam).16 BÀõabhaÇÇa narrates the entire story of Harshacharita as it happened in the remote past. Thus, he cannot be a contemporary of Sri Harsha of SthÀõvÁœvara. According to BÀõabhaÇÇa, Sri Harsha annexed the kingdom of Sindh (atra puruÈottamena SindhurÀjam pramathya lakœmÁrÀtmÁyÀ kÃtÀ). Sindh was an independent kingdom in the 7th century CE and there is no evidence to prove the Sri Harsha’s victory over Sindh. The Chacha NÀmÀ is completely ignorant of this victory of Sri Harsha over Sindh. This supports the argument that Sri Harsha flourished in the 5th century BCE and founded an era in 457 BCE. He established a vast empire that included Nepal and KÀmarÂpa in the east to Sindh in the west. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang visited India between 629 CE and 645 CE whereas Sri Harsha ruled in the 5th century BCE, more than 1000 years before him. Thus, Hiuen Tsang cannot be a contemporary of Sri Harsha. Western historians and their followers completely distorted the historical account given by Hiuen Tsang because they believed that Sri Harsha flourished in the 7th century CE. Probably, Hiuen Tsang visited the court of King Siharasa, the son of Rasal mentioned in the Chacha-\n247 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA NÀmÀ and the same king Siharasa (Sri Harsha) was mentioned in some Kashmirian sources who ruled 664 years after VikramÀditya (57 BCE). The inscriptions of the Early Chalukyas claim that Pulakeœin II defeated Harsha or Harshavardhana and acquired the title of Parameœvara. The Kurtaketi grant dated in Saka 530 (53 BCE) has the earliest reference to the defeat of Harshavardhana, the king of UttarÀpatha (SakalottarÀpatheœvara-Œri-Harshavardhana-parÀjayopalabdha- Parameœvarara-parama-nÀmadheyasya).17 Western historians assumed the epoch of the Œaka era and the ŒÀlivÀhana era as the same in 78 CE but the Œaka era started in 583 BCE whereas the ŒÀlivÀhana era started in 78 CE as discussed in detail in",

    "content": ". Historians wrongly fixed the date of Pulakeœin II and Sri Harsha in the 7th century and believed that Pulakeœin II defeated Sri Harsha. Pulakeœin II flourished in the 1st century BCE whereas Sri Harsha flourished in the 5th century BCE. Thus, both cannot be contemporaries. If, for argument’s sake, we assume that Pulakeœin II was ruling in the 7th century CE, he must have defeated Sri Harsha at a date earlier than that of ŒÀlivÀhana 530 (608 CE). According to JF Fleet, Hiuen Tsang visited the court of Ho-li-sha-fa-t’an-ha or Harshavardhana, otherwise called Shi-lo-o’-t’ie-to or SÁlÀditya and apparently visited a capital of the kingdom of Mo-ho-la-ch’a or Maharashtra, the king of which was named Pu-lo-ki-she or Pulakeœin II.18 Since Hiuen Tsang sojourned in India from 629 CE to 645 CE, JF Fleet argued that the date of the defeat of Harshavardhana cannot be earlier than 630 CE. Fleet was so obsessed with his distorted chronology of India that he even declared the Kurtaketi grant as spurious to promote his concocted theory. Since historians believed that Hiuen Tsang was a contemporary of Pulakeœin II and Sri Harsha, they made wild speculations from the historical account of Hiuen Tsang. Hiuen Tsang tells us that the king lived in peace for thirty years without raising a weapon which is absolutely incorrect with reference to Sri Harsha. The so-called king ŒÁlÀditya referred by Hiuen Tsang cannot be the Sri Harsha of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty. Now the question is who was Harsha or Harshavardhana, the contemporary of Pulakeœin II? In all likelihood, he was Harsha VikramÀditya of Ujjain who flourished in the 1st century BCE.\n248 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA VikramÀditya, the so-called founder of the Vikrama era in 57 BCE, was also known as Harsha as mentioned by Kalhaõa of RÀjataraôgiõÁ (TatrÀnehasyujjayinyÀm ŒrimÀn HarshaparÀbhidhaÍ| EkaccÍatraœcchakravarti VikramÀditya ityabhÂt|| ).19 SÀgaranandin of NÀÇakaratnakoœa also referred to him as Sri Harsha Vikrama.20 In my view, the Harsha VikramÀditya referred to in various sources must be identified as VikramÀditya of Ujjain (1st century BCE) and not the PuÈpabhÂti king Sri Harsha (5th century BCE). Sri Harsha of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty never had the title ‘VikramÀditya’. Kalhaõa also refers to Harsha VikramÀditya as “EkaccÍatraœcchakravarti” meaning the most powerful emperor. Harsha VikramÀditya was referred to in the Kurtaketi grant of the early Chalukyas as the king of UttarÀpatha. According to KÀlidÀsa’s JyotirvidÀbharaõa, VikramÀditya conquered Draviça, LÀÇa, Vaôga, Gauça, Gurjara, DhÀrÀ and KÀmbhoja. Undoubtedly, Harsha VikramÀditya was a contemporary of the early Chalukya Pulakeœin II. Harsha VikramÀditya lost control over Draviça (°ndhra and Chola kingdoms) during his conflict with Pulakeœin II. Undoubtedly, the Harsha or Harshavardhana mentioned in the early Chalukya grants was none other than Harsha VikramÀditya and the war between Harsha VikramÀditya and Pulakeœin II occurred at a date earlier than 53 BCE. Harsha VikramÀditya sent KÀlidÀsa as his emissary to the court of Kuntaleœvara i.e. Pulakeœin II after his defeat; KÀlidÀsa beautifully narrates his experience as an emissary in his work “Kuntaleœvaradautyam” which is unfortunately now lost. The Navasari grant of Gurjara king JayabhaÇa II dated in Kalachuri- Chedi era 456 (53 CE) tells us that Dadda I had protected the Valabhi ruler who had been overpowered by the king Harshadeva (Sri- HarshadevÀbhibhÂta-ValabhÁpati-trÀõopÀrjjita......).21 It may be noted that while the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403 BCE, historians wrongly concluded that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced around 249 CE. The only inscription of JayabhaÇa I, the son of Dadda I is dated in Kalachuri-Chedi era 355 (48 BCE)22 and the earliest inscription of Dadda II, the son of JayabhaÇa I is dated in Kalachuri-Chedi era 380 (23 BCE).23 Harshadeva or Harsha VikramÀditya must have defeated the Valabhi ruler at a date prior to 48 BCE. Probably, the Valabhi ruler was\n249 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA either the Maitraka king Dharasena II who ruled around 83-60 BCE or the Maitraka king SÁlÀditya I who ruled around 60-40 BCE. If the Kalachuri-Chedi era had commenced in 249 CE, the date of the inscription of Jayabhata I works out to be 604 CE (355) which means Harshadeva defeated the Valabhi ruler at a date earlier than 604 CE. Colonial historians distorted these facts and concocted that it was Dadda II and not Dadda I who protected the Valabhi ruler. The inscription of JayabhaÇa II unambiguously tells us that it was Dadda I not Dadda II who protected the Valabhi ruler. Historians again concocted that JayabhaÇa II of the NavasÀri grant was actually JayabhaÇa III and that he had not mentioned the names of Dadda I and JayabhaÇa I (the names of these two fictitious kings were concocted by eminent historians) in his genealogy. Thus, eminent historians converted Dadda I to Dadda II, Dadda II to Dadda III, JayabhaÇa II to JayabhaÇa III and JayabhaÇa III to JayabhaÇa IV by creating two more fictitious kings in their genealogy as these concoctions were absolutely necessary to prove that Sri Harsha flourished after 606 CE. Sri Harsha of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty lived in the 5th century BCE and he cannot be a contemporary of the Gurjara king Dadda I and the early Chalukya king Pulakeœin II. It appears probable enough that it was Harsha VikramÀditya who defeated the Valabhi king at a date earlier than 48 BCE. Seemingly, Dadda I could provide protection to the Valabhi king Dharasena II or SÁlÀditya I because Harsha VikramÀditya immediately engaged in the conflict with Pulakeœin II and suffered defeat. More precisely, these events occurred at a date earlier than 53 BCE because the Kurtaketi grant of 53 BCE records the victory of Pulakeœin II over Harshavardhana. Thus, Harsha VikramÀditya of Ujjain was the contemporary of Pulakeœin II and not Sri Harsha of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty. Historians also claimed that the Ahar24 and Peheva inscriptions25 of PratÁhÀra Bhojadeva are dated in the Sri Harsha era. The calendar used in these inscriptions is ChaitrÀdi whereas Sri Harsha era followed KÀrttikÀdi calendar. The Anantaliôgeœvara inscription26 of the LiccÍavi king Narendradeva dated in the Sri Harsha era clearly indicates that the calendar of the Sri Harsha era was KÀrttikÀdi. Therefore, it is incorrect\n250 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA to say that the PratÁhÀra king Bhojadeva used the Sri Harsha era in his inscriptions. Actually, Bhojadeva used two eras i.e. the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). Thus, the Ahar and Peheva inscriptions are dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era and not in the Sri Harsha era. In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE as correctly recorded by Alberuni. The epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era It is well known from the literature and epigraphic evidence that MÀhiÈmatÁ (near Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh) was the capital of the Kalachuri dynasty (MÀhiÈmatÁm KalachureÍ kula-rÀjadhÀnÁm)27 and Tripuri in DÀhala deœa (near Jabalpur) was the capital of the Chedi dynasty. Probably, the Kalachuris and Chedis were the descendants of the ancient Haihaya dynasty. The era used in the inscriptions of the Kalachuris of MÀhiÈmatÁ and the Chedis of Tripuri is referred to as the Kalachuri- Chedi era. This era was also found in the inscriptions of the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ, the Gurjaras, the Sendrakas and the early Chalukyas of Gujarat, etc. There is no direct evidence to prove the exact epoch of the Kalachuri- Chedi era.The calendar of the Kalachuri-Chedi era was KÀrttikÀdi and generally followed the AmÀnta scheme. The epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era can be calculated based on the verifiable details of dates given in epigraphs and the other references. Historians calculated various epochs of the Kalachuri era ranging from 244 CE to 250 CE. Dr. VV Mirashi argued that the earliest inscriptions from Gujarat and Maharashtra dated up to the year 490 followed the era which commenced on the AmÀnta KÀrttika œukla pratipadÀ i.e. 25th September 249 CE whereas later inscriptions dated from the year 722 to the year 969 which come from Vindhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh followed the era which commenced on the PÂrõimÀnta KÀrttika œukla pratipadÀ i.e. 6th October 248 CE.28 Thus, the Kalachuri-Chedi era originally commenced in 249 CE but consequently it became antedated by one year i.e. 248 CE and while the calendar originally followed the AmÀnta scheme,\n251 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA subsequently its months became PÂrõimÀnta. Eminent historians agreed with Mirashi because this unusual approach not only gives them a convenient platform to explain the dates mentioned in the inscriptions but also facilitates the justification of their distorted chronology. It is nothing but ridiculous to accept that Indians followed two different epochs of the same era. There is nothing to support this unusual and speculative theory of historians. Ancient Indians being well advanced in astronomy, the calendar or PaðchÀôga adopted by them was highly scientific and based on accurate calculations. It can be somehow reconciled that the calendar of the Kalachuri-Chedi era was originally based on the AmÀnta scheme and later its months became pÂrõimÀnta but there is no logical justification for antedating the era by one year. The method of antedating the era by one year will be highly unscientific and Indian astronomers would have never accepted such an unscientific approach because it would have changed the scheme of intercalary months, ahargaõa, etc. Every Indian era has only one epoch and Kalachuri-Chedi era would have also commenced from only one epoch. There were many siddhÀntas of astronomy in vogue in ancient India. Therefore, it is always difficult to prove all the dates of inscriptions with reference to modern SÂrya SiddhÀnta or other available siddhÀntas. It would be more appropriate to reconstruct the calendar of a particular era based on the dates and other details given in the inscriptions for finding the correct siddhÀnta applicable. We need to focus on verifiable data like solar eclipses and lunar eclipses that, irrespective of the siddhÀnta followed by the calendar of an era, can be traced in history. The inscriptions of the Gurjara kings and the early Chalukyas of Gujarat were dated in the Kalachuri-Chedi era and some of them were also dated in the Œaka era (583 BCE). These inscriptions roughly indicate the starting point of the Kalachuri-Chedi era. Based on the study of the solar eclipses and lunar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi era, it is easy to conclude that the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403-402 BCE. The Sarkho grant of Ratnadeva II, issued in Kalachuri year 880 on the occasion of a total lunar eclipse, provides the strongest evidence of\n252 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the starting point of Kalachuri-Chedi era.29 King Ratnadeva II belonged to the family of the Kalachuris of Ratanpur and the great astronomer PadmanÀbha, respected as the VarÀhamihira of his era (VÀrÀhamihiropamaÍ) was a member of his court. PadmanÀbha was plausibly the senior contemporary of Bhaskaracharya of SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi as Bhaskaracharya had quoted a rule from PadmanÀbha’s treatise on algebra to establish the theory that a quadratic equation has generally two roots.30 Unfortunately, all of PadmanÀbha’s works are now lost. Once, in the court of Ratnadeva II and in the presence of astronomers, PadmanÀbha predicted that when the day of GÁÍpati or VÀchaspati i.e. Thursday ends in the year 880 and the full moon occurs in KÃttikÀ nakœatra, a total lunar eclipse will commence during the third quarter of the night i.e. 0:00 AM to 3:00 AM and the time when moon enters into the asterism RohiõÁ. TenÀœÁtyadhikÀÈÇa-vatsara-œate jÀte dine GÁÍpateÍ, KÀrttikyÀmatha RohiõÁbha-samaye ratreœca yÀma-traye| Œrimad-Ratnanareœvarasya sadasi jyotirvidÀmagrataÍ, SarvagrÀsamanuÈõagah pravadatÀ tirõõa pratijðÀnadÁ|| 31 Considering the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era in 403-402 BCE, 476-477 CE would be the current year and 477-478 CE would be the elapsed year of the Sarkho grant. The verifiable details given in the Sarkho grant correspond regularly with the date 7th Nov 477 CE. We can ignore the weekday because it can only be verified with reference to the SiddhÀnta followed by PadmanÀbha. But PadmanÀbha clearly tells us about the end of a weekday before the end of KÃttikÀ nakœatra, the starting of RohiõÁ nakœatra and the beginning of total lunar eclipse in RohiõÁ nakœatra. The weekday of 6th Nov 477 CE i.e. Thursday (according to PadmanÀbha) ended at 12:00 AM and Friday started at 0:00 hrs on 7th Nov 477 CE. KÃttikÀ nakœatra ended at 00:23 AM on 7th Nov 477 CE and RohiõÁ nakœatra started at the same time. Total lunar eclipse started at 2:06 hrs and ended at 7:27 hrs on 7th Nov 477 CE. Thus, the end of KÃttikÀ nakœatra, the starting of RohiõÁ nakœatra and the beginning of total lunar eclipse in RohiõÁ nakœatra occurred in the third quarter of the night i.e. 0:00 hrs to 3:00 hrs and after the end of a weekday.\n253 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA Interestingly, when the eclipse occurred at the time predicted by PadmanÀbha, king Ratnadeva became pleased and donated the village ChinchÀtalÀi situated in the mandala of Anarghavalli to the great astronomer PadmanÀbha by issuing Sarkho copper plates. Dr. VV Mirashi stated that Sarkho grant was issued on 8th Nov 1128 CE considering the epoch in 248 CE but the eclipse started in the second quarter of the night. The total lunar eclipse started at 23:27 hrs on 8th Nov and ended at 5:36 hrs on 9th Nov 1128 CE. This total lunar eclipse cannot qualify the details i.e. the end of Thursday (JÀte dine GÁÍpateÍ) and the third quarter of the night (ratreœca yÀmatraye) given by PadmanÀbha. Thus, the epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era fixed by the historians is not tenable. Mischievously, historians replaced the word “JÀte” with “YÀte” by distorting the statement of PadmanÀbha and propagated that “YÀte dine GÁÍpateÍ” means the arrival of Thursday not the end of Thursday. The Sendraka kings also used the Kalachuri era. The Kasare grant of NikuÚbhÀllaœakti is dated in the year 404 (0-1 CE) on the occasion of solar eclipse on new moon day of °ÈÀçha month.32 The verifiable details given in the Kasare grant correspond regularly with the date 10th June 1 CE. The solar eclipse was visible between 6:45 hrs to 8:44 hrs on 10th June 1 CE.\n254 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Therefore, it can be concluded that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced from 3rd Oct 403 BCE and the calendar was KÀrttikÀdi. Dr. VV Mirashi calculated the date of the Kasare grant as 1st June 653 CE considering the epoch in 249 CE. Thus, historians calculated the date of the Sarkho grant considering the epoch in 248 CE whereas they calculated the date of the Kasare grant considering the epoch in 249 CE. There is no evidence to support that Indians followed two different epochs while using the Kalachuri-Chedi era. Every Indian era has only one epoch and Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced from 3rd Oct 403 BCE. In the event it commenced in 248-249 CE, the Kalachuri era was in vogue till the beginning of the 13th century CE. Alberuni refers to the kingdom of DÀhala but did not mention the Kalachuri-Chedi era. According to the epoch of 248-249 CE, the Kalachuri era was commonly used in the 11th century CE and that begs the question as to how Alberuni was completely ignorant of this era. In fact, the Kalachuri era commenced in 403 BCE and became extinct by the 7th century CE. ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) became popular from the 9th century CE onwards over the whole of North India and memories of the Kalachuri era in the public mind completely faded away by the 11th century CE and hence, Alberuni could not get any information about Kalachuri-Chedi era. Let us calculate the dates of the inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi era based on the epoch from 403-402 BCE.\n255 Solar eclipses 1.

Except the solar eclipse in Kalachuri year 885 and the lunar eclipse in Kalachuri year 969, all solar and lunar eclipses were visible in India and correspond regularly with the dates mentioned in the inscriptions which bear reference to the epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era that commenced in 403 BCE. SaÚkrÀnti dates need further research to reconcile the details recorded in the inscriptions. However, 3rd Oct 403 BCE can be fixed as the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era with reference to certain dates of inscriptions mentioned in the Œaka era (583 BCE) and the strongly verifiable details of the Kasare and Sarkho grants. Who was the originator of the Kalachuri-Chedi era? Dr. Mirashi opined that the °bhÁra king Iœvarasena, the founder of the °bhÁra dynasty, may have started this era. According to the PurÀõas, °bhÁra kings succeeded the ŒÀtavÀhanas and ruled for 67 years. The Nasik cave inscription53 of Iœvarasena is dated in his 9th regnal year. But the inscriptions of the Kalachuri and Chedi kings referred to the era as “Kalachuri SaÚvat” or “Chedi SaÚvat”. Therefore, it is not logical to assume that the Kalachuris adopted the regnal years of the °bhÁra kings and later transformed it into an era. The Kalachuris and Chedis were the descendants of the ancient Haihaya dynasty that belongs to the MahÀbhÀrata era. Seemingly, the Kalachuris established a powerful kingdom in MÀhiÈmatÁ around 403 BCE and founded an era as the earliest inscriptions issued from the city of MÀhiÈmatÁ are dated around Kalachuri year 167(236 BCE).54 Assumably, MahÀrÀja Subandhu and his ancestors belonged to the Kalachuri dynasty and founded the Kalachuri-Chedi era. The Maharajas of ValkhÀ According to Dr. Mirashi, the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ, who were probably the earliest feudatories of the Kalachuris, used Kalachuri era in their inscriptions. More than 35 inscriptions of the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n260 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA have been discovered so far and found to be dated from the year 29 to 117.55 Some historians opined that these inscriptions were dated in the Gupta era. It is difficult to establish whether these inscriptions were dated in the Kalachuri era or the Gupta era. Since the kingdom of ValkhÀ was very close to the Kalachuri kingdom, it is deducible that the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ used Kalachuri era in their inscriptions. ValkhÀ is undoubtedly the present village BÀgh in DhÀr district of Madhya Pradesh, close to the NarmadÀ River. The genealogy and chronology of the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ: Kalachuri-Chedi era(403-402 BCE) In CE BhaÇÇÀraka 29-36 374-367 BCE Bhulunça I 37-59 366-344 BCE SvÀmidÀsa 60-68 343-335 BCE RudradÀsa I 66-85 337-318 BCE Bhulunça II 86-107 317-296 BCE RudradÀsa II 108-117 295-286 BCE NÀgabhaÇa — — Some historians opined that MahÀrÀja Subandhu belonged to the family of the MahÀrÀjas of ValkhÀ. The inscriptions of Subandhu were issued from the city of MÀhiÈmatÁ and not from the city of ValkhÀ and do not mention “ParamabhaÇÇÀraka-pÀdÀnudhyÀta”. Therefore, it may be confidently stated that Subandhu did not belong to the family of ValkhÀ. The TraikÂÇakas TrikÂÇa or a three-peaked mountain is situated in AparÀnta or North Konkan. A royal family ruled around TrikÂÇa was called as TraikÂÇaka. It seems that Kalachuri era was popular in Konkan. The inscriptions of TraikÂÇaka kings were dated from the Kalachuri years 207 to 284. Kalachuri-Chedi era (403-402 BCE) In CE DÀhrasena 207-240 196-163 BCE VyÀghrasena 240-250 163-153 BCE Madhyamasena 250-270 153-133 BCE Vikramasena 270-284 133-119 BCE\n261 The KaÇachchuris We learn from the Abhona grant dated in the year 347 that Œaôkaragaõa, the king of the KaÇachchuri dynasty, conquered Ujjayini and established his kingdom.56 Some historians conclude, without any evidence, that the KaÇachchuris were the early Kalachuris and used the Kalachuri era in their inscriptions. Actually, KaÇachchuri was a different royal dynasty which presumably used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719- 718 BCE) and not the Kalachuri era. Historians also mistakenly identified MaôgalarÀja of the Nerur grant57 with the early Chalukya king MaôgalÁœvara and concluded that MaôgalÁœvara defeated the KaÇachchuri king BuddharÀja, the son of Œaôkaragaõa. The Kurtaketi grant58 of Chalukya VikramÀditya is dated in Œaka 530 and in his 16th regnal year. Therefore, the rule of MaôgalÁœvara must have ended by Saka 515. Thus, MaôgalÁœvara’s rule ended at least 3 years before the KaÇachchuri king Œaôkaragaõa could establish his kingdom in Ujjayini. Moreover, the Vadner and Sarsavni grants of BuddharÀja59 are dated in the year 360 and 361 respectively which means BuddharÀja was defeated after the year 361. It is therefore totally absurd to conclude that MaôgalarÀja of the Nerur grant was MaôgalÁœvara who defeated BuddharÀja. The genealogy given in the Nerur grant tells us that MaôgalarÀja was the son of Vallabha. There is no mention of the names of Pulakeœin I and KÁrtivarman I. Therefore, MaôgalarÀja of the Nerur grant, the son of Vallabha, was the anterior Chalukya king and not MangalÁœvara, the son of KÁrtivarman I. It is also clear from the above that the dates of the KaÇachchuri inscriptions cannot be explained in the chronology of the Kalachuri era. The KaÇachchuris probably used the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. The chronology of the KaÇachchuri dynasty: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE KrishnarÀja — — Œaôkaragaõa 347-355 372-364 BCE BuddharÀja 355-361 364-358 BCE THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n262 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The Marruturu grant of Satyaœraya,60 the Mudhol grant of Pugavarman,61 the Kaira grant of VijayarÀja62 and the Godchi grant of KaÇÇi Arasa63 mention the existence of Chalukya kings prior to the establishment of the early Chalukya dynasty by JayasiÚha I. Two grants issued by Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana from RÀjamahendravaram are dated in Kaliyuga era 2625 (477 BCE) and 2628 (474 BCE).64 MaôgalarÀja of the Nerur grant was reigning in the 4th century BCE and defeated BuddharÀja around 359 BCE. It appears that the Kaira grant of VijayarÀja was also dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and was issued in the year 394 (325 BCE). The Mankani grant of the KaÇachchuri king TaralasvÀmi is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama 346 (373 BCE)65 thereby indicating that one more family of the KaÇachchuris existed around 373 BCE. The genealogy of the king TaralasvÀmi: KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) In CE MaharÀja Nanna — — SÂrya-BhÀvuka — — TaralasvÀmi 373 BCE Historians unduly rejected the Mankani grant because the date was expressed in decimal notation; however, it is well-established that Indians were conversant with decimal notation since ancient times as Aryabhata (as discussed in",

Piôgala’s CÍandaœÀstra and SarvanandÁ’s LokavibhÀga explicitly mention zero and decimal place notation. An inscription of the early Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana dated in Kaliyuga era 2628 (474 BCE) expressed the year in positional notation as “KalyÀdyabda-gaõe’ÈÇa-netra-rasa-dossaôkhye gate vatsare” (aÈÇa = 8, netra = 2, rasa = 6 and doÍ = 2). Therefore, it can be clearly seen that the Mankani grant is absolutely genuine. The Early Gurjaras The Gurjara kings reigned in Southern Gujarat and Northern Maharashtra. They were the descendants of MahÀrÀja Karõa of the\n263 MahÀbhÀrata era. The inscriptions of the early Gurjara kings were dated in the Kalachuri era from the year 355 to 486. Dadda I, the first known king of the early Gurjaras protected the Maitraka king of Valabhi when he was attacked by Harshadeva or Harsha VikramÀditya. The earliest inscription of JayabhaÇa I was dated in the year 35566 and the last inscription of JayabhaÇa III was dated in the year 486.67 The chronology of the early Gurjaras: Kalachuri-Chedi era (403-402 BCE) In CE Dadda I 330-354 73-49 BCE JayabhaÇa I 355-380 48-23 BCE Dadda II 380-427 23 BCE-24 CE JayabhaÇa II 428-460 25-57 CE Ahirola 461-480 58-77 CE JayabhaÇa III 480-486 77-83 CE The inscriptions of the Gurjaras tell us that it was Dadda I and not Dadda II who protected the Valabhi ruler from Harshadeva or Harsha VikramÀditya (Parameœvara-Œri-HarshadevÀbhibhÂta-valabhÁ-pati- paritrÀõopajÀta-bhramadabhra-subhra-vibhrama-yaœovitÀnaÍ Œri-DaddaÍ). Historians concocted the fable that JayabhaÇa II of the Navasari grant was actually JayabhaÇa III and that he had not mentioned the names of Dadda I and JayabhaÇa I in his genealogy. Thus, eminent historians converted Dadda I to Dadda II, Dadda II to Dadda III, Jayabhata II to Jayabhata III and Jayabhata III to Jayabhata IV by creating two more fictitious kings in their genealogy. Thus, historians proved, by distorting the facts, that the Harshadeva mentioned by Gurjaras was Sri Harsha of PuÈpabhÂti dynasty who flourished after 606 CE. Actually, the Harshadeva mentioned by the Gurjaras was Harsha VikramÀditya of Avanti not Sri Harsha of SthÀõvÁœvara. Some inscriptions of the Later Gurjaras were dated in the ŒÀlivÀhana era from the year 400 to 417. The Umeta grant of Dadda IV was dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 400 (478 CE),68 the Bagumra grant in ŒÀlivÀhana 415 (493 CE) and the Ilao grant of Dadda IV in ŒÀlivÀhana 417 (495 CE).69 THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n264 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the Later Gurjaras: ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) In CE Dadda III 350-375 428-453 CE JayabhaÇa IV 375-400 453-478 CE Dadda IV 400-417 478-495 CE Historians rejected all the three inscriptions of the Later Gurjaras as spurious because they could not explain the dates of these inscriptions in their distorted chronology. In fact, they were ignorant of the difference between Œaka era (583 BCE) and ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). The Sendrakas The Sendrakas were the feudatories of the KadaÚba kings and the early Chalukyas of Gujarat. The earliest known king of the Sendrakas was BhÀnuœakti and the Halsi grant of Harivarman was issued in his 5th regnal year at the request of the Sendraka king BhÀnuœakti.70 Interestingly, the inscriptions of the Sendrakas used the Kalachuri era and the Œaka era and provide invaluable information about the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era. The Kasare grant71 and Bagumra grant72 of °llaœakti, the grandson of BhÀnuœakti, were dated in Kalachuri year 404 (0-1 CE) and 406 (2-3 CE) respectively. The Nagad grant of °llaœakti73 is dated in Œaka 577 (6 BCE) and the Mundakhede grant74 of Jayaœakti in Œaka 602 (19 CE).

    "content": ".\n265 The Kalachuris and Chedis of Tripuri The Kalachuri and Chedi kings traced their origin from the legendary king KÀrtavÁryÀrjuna of the RÀmÀyaõa era who successfully subjugated RÀvaõa (RÀvaõam yo babandha). According to some inscriptions, PurÂravÀ, NahuÈa and Haihaya were their ancestors. KÀrtavÁryÀrjuna, the son of KÃtavÁrya was the descendant of the Haihaya dynasty. The Kalachuri and Chedi kings proudly proclaimed themselves as “Haihayas” meaning the descendants of the Haihaya dynasty. Originally, MÀhiÈmatÁ was the capital of the kingdom of Kalachuris and Chedis but later, Tripuri in DÀhala deœa (Tiwar near Jabalpur) became their capital around the 3rd century CE. We learn from the inscriptions that Kokalladeva I was the founder of the Tripuri branch of the Kalachuri dynasty. VV Mirashi opined that VÀmarÀjadeva of the Saugor inscription75 ought to be the founder of the Tripuri branch of the Chedi dynasty and the VÀmadeva mentioned in the inscriptions of the Chedi king Karõa and later kings is identical to VÀmarÀjadeva. None of the inscriptions mention the name of VÀmarÀjadeva or VÀmadeva in the genealogy of the Kalachuri kings but the inscriptions of king Karõa and his successors mention “Parama-bhaÇÇÀraka-mahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja-parameœvara-Œri-VÀmÀdeva- PÀdÀnudhyÀta........”. In all likelihood, VÀmadeva may be another name of Kokalladeva I, the founder of the Tripuri branch of the Kalachuri dynasty or the illustrious Kalachuri king GÀôgeyadeva, the father of King Karõa. Historians wrongly identified the Saugor inscription as the inscription of Kalachuris. King Œaôkaragaõa referred to in the Saugor and Chhoti Deori inscriptions76 may be the one who was protected by Kokalladeva I (Œaôkaragaõe ca rÀjani yasyasÁdabhayadaÍ pÀõiÍ).77 According to the KÀritalÀi inscription, King LakœmaõarÀja was ruling in Kalachuri year 593 (190 CE).78 It mentions the rout of the PratÁhÀra king NÀgabhaÇa (140-170 CE) and praises the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AmoghavarÈa I (157-213 CE) [Bhagne NÀgabhaÇe...... ŒrimadamoghavarÈa- nÃpatiÍ pÀdau.....]. Undoubtedly, king LakœmaõarÀjadeva was a contemporary of the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king AmoghavarÈa I and the Kalachuri king Kokalladeva. We have no information about the relationship between LakœmaõarÀja of KÀritalÀi inscription and THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n266 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Kokalladeva. In all probability, LakœmaõarÀja was the younger brother of Kokalladeva as mentioned in the Kahla grant of Sodhadeva. All the Kalachuri inscriptions unanimously refer to Kokalladeva I as the founder of the Tripuri branch of the Kalachuri dynasty. The Amoda plates of Prithvideva I refer to Kokalla as “Chedyadi-KœitÁœa” meaning the earliest king of the Chedis.79 The Bilhari stone inscription also mentions that, having conquered the whole earth, Kokalla set up two pillars of victory, the KrishnarÀja in the South and Bhojadeva in the North. The Banaras grant of Karõa tells us that Kokalla gave protection to Bhoja, VallabharÀja, Sri-Harsha (the king of ChitrakÂta) and Œaôkaragaõa. The Bhoja mentioned here is the PratÁhÀra king Bhojadeva or Mihira Bhoja. Thus, Kokalla was a contemporary of PratÁhÀra Bhojadeva (174-234 CE) and the time of Kokalla can be fixed around 180-210 CE. The Amoda grant tells us that Kokalla had eighteen sons. The eldest son of Kokalla became the king of Tripuri and he made his brothers kings of various mandalas (AÈÇÀdaœÀri-karikuÚbha-vibhaôga-siÚhÀÍ putrÀ babhÂvuratiœauryaparÀœca tasya | TatrÀgrajo nÃpavaras-TripurÁœa ÀsÁt pÀrœve ca mandalapatÁn sa cakÀra bandhÂn|| ). According to the Bilhari inscription, Kokalla was followed by his son Mugdhatuôga who, also known as Prasiddhadhavala, was likely the eldest son of Kokalla. It appears that Mugdhatuõga was also called Baddega as the Sudi grant of the Gaôga king Butuga II dated in Saka 860 (277 CE) mentions Tripuri kings Baddega and Krishna.80 When the Gaôga kingdom was in trouble, Butuga II approached the Chedi King Baddega at Tripuri and impressed upon him that he could be instrumental in strengthening the Chedi rule in Southern region. Baddega married off his daughter to Butuga II to ensure his loyalty to Chedi kings. “TasyÀnujo nijabhujÀrjjita-sampadÀrthÁ BhÂvallabham samupagatya DahÀla-deœe, Œri-Baddegam tadanu tasya sutÀm sahaiva vakkanyayÀ vyavahaduktavidhis-TripuryÀm|| ” Dr. Mirashi quotes the following extract from an ancient manuscript in possession of Dr. SN Sen, Keeper of the Nepal Museum.\n267 Gatavati Œaka-kÀle maôgaleÈvaÈÇa-saôkhye, Œaradi viœadapakœe cÀœvineœukravÀre| Uçuni SurapatÁœe yoga °yuÈmatÁyam, Tithirapi ca gatÀnÀm PaðchamÁ yatra œuddhÀ|| ChedikularÀjadhÀnyÀm gatavati Œri Vandyage nihatyÀrÁn| TaccÍÀsanena vasudhÀm parirakœati KrishnarÀje’pi|| 81 “When Saka year 858 elapsed, on the 5thtithi of the bright fortnight of Aœvina Month, Friday, °yuÈmatÁ Yoga, King Œri Vandyaga or Baddega went back to Tripuri, the capital city of the Chedi Dynasty after defeating all his enemies while KrishnarÀja was governing the country in the South”. The date corresponds regularly with 12th Sep 275 CE (or 22nd Sep 274 CE). It is very likely that the Chedi king Baddega or Vandyaga was the eldest son of Kokalla who became the king of Tripuri and KrishnarÀja was the younger brother of Baddega who became king in the Southern region of the Chedi kingdom. The Gaôga king Butuga II strengthened the rule of Chedi Krishna after the death of his elder brother Baddega. In fact, Butuga II became the patron of KrishnarÀja, the Chedi king of the Southern region and seized the kingdom from the possession of Lalleya (LakœmÁm Indrasya harttum gatavati divi yad Baddegaôke mahÁœe, hÃtvÀ Lalleya hastÀd...... PrÀdÀt KrishnÀya rÀjðe....). Butuga II’s son Puõuseya Gaôga married the daughter of the Chedi King KrishnarÀja. Butuga II also defeated KakkarÀja of Achalapura, Bijja Dantivarman of VanavÀsi, RÀjavarman or Ajavarman, DÀmari the king of Nulugugiri, the NÀgavarmas and extended the Chedi kingdom up to TaðjÀpuri. Thus, the Chedi king KrishnarÀja established the Chedi Empire that included Magadha, Kaliôga, PÀnçya and Chola. Historians mistakenly identified Baddiga and Krishna mentioned in the Sudi grant as RÀÈÇrakÂÇa kings. The RÀÈÇrakÂÇas never conquered Magadha and Kaliôga in their entire history.

    "content": ". The Bilhari stone inscription of YuvarÀjadeva II gives the genealogy of the Tripuri branch of the Chedi kings. Kokalla’s eldest son Mugdhatuôga was succeeded by his son YuvarÀjadeva I also known as KeyÂravarÈa. The Banaras grant of Karõa tells us that Prasiddhadhavala or Mugdhatuôga’s elder son BÀlaharsha reigned before his younger THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n268 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA brother YuvarÀjadeva I came to power. Nohala, daughter of the Chaulukya king Avanivarman, was the wife of YuvarÀjadeva I. The Bilhari inscription indicates that YuvarÀjadeva I established his authority over Gauda, KarõÀÇa, LÀÇa, KaœmÁra and Kaliôga. The ParamÀra king VÀkpatirÀja II claimed victory over the Tripura king YuvarÀja.82 RÀjaœekhara, the famous poet who finds mention in the Bilhari inscription (Vismita-kavi-RÀjaœekhara-stutyÀ....), flourished in the court of YuvarÀjadeva. The hero of RÀjaœekhara’s Sanskrit drama “ViddhaœÀlabhaðjikÀ” was a Chedi king VidyÀdharamalla alias KarpÂravarÈa. The story of ViddhaœÀlabhaðjikÀ, as summarised by Dr. VV Mirashi,83 is as follows: King VidyÀdharamalla alias KarpÂravarÈa of Tripuri receives at his court VÁrapÀla alias ChançamahÀsena, the lord of Kuntala, who had been deprived of his kingdom by his relatives, and falls in love with his daughter KuvalayamÀlÀ. His minister BhÀgurÀyaõa, however, comes to know from astrologers that the king who marries MÃgÀôkavallÁ, the daughter of king Chandravarman of LÀÇa will be the sovereign of the whole world. He, therefore, contrives to bring about the marriage of his lord KarpÂravarÈa with MÃgÀôkavallÁ. Interestingly, KarpÂravarÈa’s queen MadanasundarÁ, who was also the niece of Chandravarman, unknowingly induces the king to marry MÃgÀôkavallÁ. The queen realises her mistake when it is too late. Then, a messenger of the king’s General Œri Vatsa comes with the following letter: “Through the power of Your Majesty, who is an ornament of the Kalachuris, and the policy of the Minister BhÀgurÀyaõa, all the mighty kings of the east, west and north have already been subdued. Only those of the south did not submit. VÁrapÀla, the lord of Kuntala sought Your Majesty’s protection. We placed VÁrapÀla at our head and encamped on the bank of the PayoÈõÁ River.” The general then describes how his forces fought with a confederacy of several kings, viz. those of KarõÀÇa, SiÚhala, PÀnçya, Murala, °ndhra, Kuntala, Koôkaõa and others, defeated them and placed VÁrapÀla on the throne. BhÀgurÀyaõa then declares that the Kalachuri king reigns supreme over the whole country.\n269 Undoubtedly, poet Rajaœekhara’s ViddhaœÀlabhaðjikÀ is based on historical fiction and clearly indicates that the Kalachuris established the mightiest empire in North India in the second half of the 3rd century CE. Some historians opined that the hero of the drama may be RÀjaœekhara’s contemporary Chedi king YuvarÀjadeva I alias KeyÂravarÈa. LakœmaõarÀja succeeded his father YuvarÀjadeva I and subjugated the kings of Oçra and Kosala. His elder son Œaôkaragaõa and younger son YuvarÀjadeva II succeeded him. The Bilhari stone inscription was engraved during the reign of YuvarÀjadeva II. Kokalladeva II ascended the throne after his father YuvarÀjadeva II. The Mukundpur inscription84 tells us that GÀôgeyadeva was ruling in Kalachuri year 772 (369 CE). GÀôgeyadeva was the son of Kokalladeva II. It appears that the Kalachuris lost Tripuri to the ParamÀras. Bhoja established a powerful ParamÀra kingdom in the 4th century. Therefore, the Kalachuris migrated to PrayÀga and VÀrÀõasi region during the reign of Kokalladeva II. King Karõa, the son of GÀôgeyadeva, issued the Banaras grant85 from PrayÀga in Kalachuri year 793 on the occasion of the first annual ŒrÀddha of his father which means GÀôgeyadeva died on the 2ndtithi of the dark fortnight of PhÀlguna month in the year 792 i.e. 28th Feb 389 CE and Karõa ascended the throne on 1st March 389 CE. Karõa established a settlement of the BrÀhmaõas called KarõÀvatÁ or KarõaprakÀœa. The Rewa stone inscription86 is dated in Kalachuri year 812 (409 CE) and in the 9th year from the establishment of KarõaprakÀœa, clearly indicating that Karõa established KarõaprakÀœa or KarõÀvatÁ in Kalachuri year 803 (400 CE). Some historians wrongly calculated the Kalachuri year of the Goharwa grant87 of Karna as 799 considering the regnal years. The Goharwa grant was issued in the 7th year from the establishment of KarõaprakÀœa. Thus, the Goharwa grant must be dated in Kalachuri year 810 (407 CE). Karõa married the HÂõa princess named °valladevi and his son was YaœaÍkarõa. The Khairha grant88 of YaœaÍkarõa is dated in Kalachuri year 823 (420 CE). YaœaÍkarõa defeated the °ndhra king and worshipped the god BhÁmeœvara near the GodÀvarÁ. Probably, YaœaÍkarõa defeated the eastern Chalukya king Kulottuôga Choçadeva I (401-450 CE). It THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n270 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA appears that the Kalachuris recaptured Tripuri and DÀhala deœa during the reign of YaœaÍkarõa. The Jabalpur grant of YaœaÍkarõa89 was dated in the year 529. Eminent historians could not explain the era used in this grant. Undoubtedly, the Jabalpur grant used the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) and the grant was issued on the 10thtithi of the dark fortnight of MÀgha month in the year 529 i.e. 21st Jan 472 CE. YaœaÍkarõa’s son GayÀkarõa succeeded him. The Tiwar inscription of GayÀkarõa90 was dated in Kalachuri year 902 (499 CE). We learn from the Bhera-Ghat inscription of NarasiÚha91 dated in Kalachuri year 907 (504 CE) that GayÀkarõa married Alhaõadevi, the daughter of King VijayasiÚha and ŒyÀmaladevi. King VijayasiÚha belonged to the gotra of Gobhilaputra. He was the son of king VairisiÚha and the grandson of king HaôsapÀla. ŒyÀmaladevi was the daughter of MÀlava king UdayÀditya of ParamÀra dynasty (399-432 CE). Thus, Alhaõadevi was the maternal granddaughter of ParamÀra king UdayÀditya I. GayÀkarõa had two sons, NarasiÚha and JayasiÚha. The Tewar inscription of JayasiÚha92 is dated in Kalachuri year 928 (525 CE). It appears that the rule of the lineage of Kokalladeva I ended with JayasiÚha. The Rewa stone inscription93 tells us that the Kalachuri king Vijayadeva or VijayasiÚha who was reigning in Kalachuri year 944 (541 CE) was born in the family of Karõa. One Rewa grant of Vijayadeva94 is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 1253 (534 CE).

Apparently, the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla defeated GÀhadwÀla king Hariœchandra, the son of Jayachandra and became the king of KÀnyakubja (KÀnyakubjÀdhipati). The Rewa grant of MahÀraõaka KumÀrapÀladeva96 dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1297 (578 CE) mentions the glorious reign of Trailokyavarmmadeva. The grant of MahÀraõaka HarirÀjadeva97 dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1298 (579 CE) also mentions the victorious reign of Trailokyamalla. It is evident that these inscriptions refer to the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla who was ruling from KÀnyakubja. The titles like “Œrimad-VÀmadeva- pÀdÀnudhyÀta” “TrikaliôgÀdhipati”, etc. were exclusively used for Kalachuri kings in their inscriptions. The Garra grant98 and Sagar grant99 of the Chandella king Trailokyavarman were dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1261 (542 CE) and 1264 (545 CE) respectively. This indicates that Chandella Trailokyavarman was a contemporary of Kalachuri Trailokyamalla. Some historians believed that the so-called Kalachuri Trailokyamalla was the same as the Chandella king Trailokyavarman. Cunningham speculated that the titles of Chedi princes, including the reference to VÀmadeva, have been simply transferred to a Chandella prince. There is not an iota of evidence to prove that Kalachuri Trailokyamalla was the same as Chandella Trailokyavarman. In fact, both were contemporary kings and the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla was ruling in KÀnyakubja around 560-578 CE whereas the Chandella king Trailokyavarman was ruling in KÀlinjar around 542-575 CE. The Duhreti grant and the grants of MahÀraõaka KumÀrapÀladeva THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n272 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA & HarirÀjadeva provide the strongest evidence that the epoch of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and Kalachuri era cannot be fixed in 57 BCE and 248-249 CE respectively. According to eminent historians, Kalachuri Trailokyamalla or Chandella Trailokyavarman were the same and ruled around 1204-1241 CE. The Duhreti grant referred to Trailokyamalla as MahÀrajÀdhirÀja, KÀnyakubjÀdhipati and TrikaliôgÀdhipati in 1212 CE. The GÀhadwÀla king Harœchandra also proclaimed himself MahÀrajÀdhirÀja in 1197 CE. It is well known that Mohammad Ghori conquered Delhi, Kanauj and VÀrÀõasi by 1194 CE. According to Tajul Masir and Firishta’s account, the terrorist invader Ghori destroyed more than 1000 temples and erected mosques on their foundations. He appointed his slave, the Turkish general Qutbuddin Aibak as Viceroy of Delhi in 1194 CE and returned to Ghazani. The army of Ghori controlled the area from Ranathambore, Ajmer, Delhi and the entire Ganga-Yamuna doab. The barbaric invader Bakhtiar Khilji, who was also a slave general of Ghori, completely destroyed the Universities of Nalanda and Vikramasila in 1193 CE and invaded Bengal. Qutbuddin suppressed the revolt of the RÀjÀ of Ajmer, conquered Gwalior and compelled the RÀjÀ to pay tribute in 1196 CE. He also conquered Anhilwad of Gujarat in 1197 CE. When Mohammad Ghori was assassinated by a fanatic of the Mulhida sect in A.H. 602 or 1205-06 CE, Qutbuddin, along with his lieutenant Iltutmish, declared himself a sovereign ruler and founded the Slave dynasty in 1206 CE. After the death of Qutbuddin in 1210 CE, Iltutmish founded the Delhi Sultanate and ruled from 1211 CE to 1236 CE. Based on a coin of that time, it is also established that the land revenue of Kanauj went to the imperial coffers of Delhi during the reign of Iltutmish. It is evident that Muslim invaders had established full control over North India by the end of the 12th century CE. Therefore, to assume that the wicked and barbaric Muslim invaders allowed North Indian kings to continue as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀjas would be quite misplaced. It is quite unbelievable that the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla of the Duhreti grant could establish his kingdom in Kanauj and proclaim himself MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja, TrikaliôgÀdhipati and KÀnyakubjÀdhipati in 1212 CE and MahÀraõaka KumÀrapÀladeva could claim Kalachuri king\n273 Trailokyavarmadeva to be TrikaliôgÀdhipati in 1241 CE when a powerful Sultanate was ruling in Delhi. Some historians thought Trikaliôga means Kosala, Utkala and Kaliôga but the Sonpur grant tells us that the king MahÀœivagupta was the lord of Kaliôga, KoôgÀda, Utkala, Kosala and Trikaliôga which clearly indicates that the geography of Trikaliôga was different from Kaliôga.100 It is quite likely that Trikaliôga was the area of Rewa, Baghelkhand, PrayÀg, VÀrÀõasi, etc. Qutbuddin has conquered the fort of KÀlinjar in 1203 CE and appointed Hasan Arnal as its governor. A Persian historian Minhaj-us- Siraj mentions in his Tabqat-e-Nasiri that Malik Nusratuddin Tayasi led an army from Gwalior towards KÀlinjar in the year A.H. 631 (1233 CE) but the king of KÀlinjar fled away. The Garra grant of Trailokyavarman is dated in 1204 CE and the grant of MahÀraõaka HarirÀjadeva in 1242 CE. Therefore, historians concocted the fiction that the Chandellas defeated the Muslim governor and recaptured their kingdom extending to Kakadadaha in Jhansi District within two years. . They simply ignored the statement of the Tabqat-e-Nasiri. In fact, KÀlinjar was in full control of Hasan Arnal and the king had been paying tribute to Qutbuddin since 1203 CE. It appears that the king of KÀlinjar stopped paying tribute during the reign of Iltutmish. Malik Nusratuddin led an army in 1233 CE and the king of KÀlinjar had no other option but to surrender his fort. Historians distorted the meaning of “TuruÈka-Yuddha” mentioned in the grant of Trailokyavarman as an explicit reference to the encounter with Turks or the Muslim governor. It may be noted that the TuruÈkas had existed in the North-Western border areas since ancient times. Kalhaõa of RÀjataraôgiõÁ mentions that HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka were TuruÈkas. Interestingly, Alberuni recorded that Hindus had Turk kings who ruled in the region of Kabul for sixty generations. “The Hindus have kings residing in Kabul, Turks who were said to be of Tibetan origin. The first of them, Barhatakin came into the country....... He wore Turkish dress...... People honoured him as a being of miraculous origin, who had been destined to be king, and in fact he brought those countries under his sway and ruled them under the title of a Shahiya of Kabul. The rule remained among his descendants for THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n274 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA generations, the number of which is said to be about sixty.”101 Actually, the so-called KuÈÀõas (as referred to by modern historians) were TuruÈkas. Thus, the TuruÈkas had existed for over 2500 years before the birth of Islam. Trailokyavarman may have fought the TuruÈka king of the 6th century CE. If indeed Trailokyavarman was the king who fled away from the fort of Kalinjar in 1233 CE, how was he referred to as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja in the grants dated around 1241-1242 CE and how could Trailokyavarman’s sons VÁravarman and HammÁravarman rule from 1243 CE to 1311 CE and claim to be KÀlinjarÀdhipati and MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja. According to the Tabqat-e-Nasiri, a RÀõÀ named Dalaki wa Malaki was ruling in a mountainous region not far from Kaça (Allahabad Dist.) which was raided by Ulugh Khan (Balban) in A.H. 645 (1247 CE). Firishta also recorded that Dalaki wa Malaki (early Baghel kings Dalakesvar and Malakesvar) resided at KÀlinjar. It is also recorded in the Muslim accounts that the Delhi Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud (1246-1266 CE) subjugated Bundelkhand and appointed his governor around 1250 CE. He was also controlling the regions of Gwalior, Chanderi and MÀlava. For the sake of argument, even if we accept the re-establishment of Chandella rule by Trailokyavarman around 1204-1242 CE, there was absolutely no scope for Trailokyavarman’s son VÁravarman and his grandsons, Bhojavarman and HammÁravarman to be KÀlinjarÀdhipati and MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja till 1289 CE or 1311 CE. Actually, eminent historians are ignorant of the difference between the epochs of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era. They believed that both eras commenced in 57 BCE.

    "content": ", the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era commenced in 719-718 BCE and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era in 57 BCE. The epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era can only be fixed in 403-402 BCE and not in 248-249 CE. All inscriptions of the Chandellas of JejÀkabhukti are dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. Thus, the Kalachuri king Trailokyamalla and the Chandella king Trailokyavarman flourished in the 6thcentury CE and not in the 13th century CE. According to ParamÀla Raso, ParamÀla was the Chandella king around 1165-1203 CE. Historians wrongly identified ParamÀla to be Paramardi. Actually Paramardi ruled in the beginning of the 6th century\n275 CE whereas Paramala ruled in the second half of the 12th century CE. Unfortunately, historians incorrectly questioned the historicity of ParamÀla RÀso and PrithvirÀja RÀso. ParamÀla RÀso tells us that ParamÀla’s eldest son Brahmajit fell fighting against PrithvirÀj Chauhan. Samarajit was the second son of ParamÀla. There is no reference of Trailokyavarman in ParamÀla RÀso. Thus, the Chandella kingdom ended in 1203 CE and their last king was ParamÀla. Probably, the Baghel kings Dalakesvar and Malakesvar annexed KÀlinjar fort from the Muslim governor after 1233 CE but lost to Ulugh Khan in 1247 CE. The Kalachuris of KalyÀõa The Bilhari inscription tells us that Kokalladeva I appointed his son KrishnarÀja in the South. He got invaluable support from the Gaôga king Butuga II in establishing a powerful kingdom as recorded in the Sudi plates. Thus, KrishnarÀja founded his lineage, the Kalachuri dynasty in the southern region. Three inscriptions i.e. the Nimbal grant,102 the Kukkanur grant103 dated in Œaka 1096 (513-514 CE) and the Behatti grant104 dated in Œaka 1105(522-523 CE), provide valuable information about this branch. Krishna was succeeded by his son Jogama and his grandson Paramardi. King Bijjaõa, the son of Paramardi, was an illustrious king of this branch. It is very likely that he subjugated the kings of the PÀnçya, Chola, Vaôga and MÀlava kingdoms (JÀçyam PÀnçyastyjati bhajate CholabhÂpaœcalatvam, bhaôgam VaôgaÍ sarati bharate MÀlavaÍ kÀlaœaôkÀm | BhÂpÀœcÀnye Jayati jagatÁm Bijjaõa-kœoõipÀle....). It appears that the Kalachuris of KalyÀõa lost their kingdom after Bijjaõa because the inscriptions simply mention the rise of king Soma (RÀjÀ Soma udait kalÀnidhi...). Historians wrongly concluded that king Soma was the son of Bijjaõa but there is no such information in the inscriptions. Probably, the Kalachuri king Soma re-established his kingdom with the help of his three brothers i.e. Saôkhamadeva, °havamalla and Siôghaõadeva. The Kukkanur grant tells us that Saôkhama was ruling in 513-514 CE. According to the Behatti grant, Siôghaõadeva was ruling in 522-523 CE. The rise of the YÀdava dynasty probably ended the rule of the Kalachuris in the South. THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n276 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the Kalachuris of KalyÀõa: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE KrishnarÀja — 270-300 CE Jogama — 300-325 CE Paramardi — 325-370 CE Bijjaõa — 370-395 CE ...... ...... ...... Soma 1075-1090 492-507 CE Saôkhamadeva 1090-1105 507-522 CE °havamalla 522 CE Siôghaõadeva 522 CE The Kalachuris of Ratanpur or South Kosala According to many Kalachuri inscriptions found in South Kosala i.e. Chattisgarh, Kokalladeva I’s grandson KaliôgarÀja established the Kalachuri kingdom near Ratanpur. His son KamalarÀja was a contemporary of GÀôgeyadeva, the Kalachuri king of Tripuri whom he helped in his campaign against the king of Utkala. KamalarÀja was succeeded by his son RatnarÀja or Ratnadeva I who, in turn, was succeeded by his son Prithvideva I whose earliest grant is dated in Kalachuri year 821 (418 CE).105 The Ratanpur inscription tells us that Prithvideva’s son JÀjalladeva I was reigning in Kalachuri year 866 (463 CE). JÀjalladeva was succeeded by his son Ratnadeva II in whose court the famous astronomer PadmanÀbha accurately predicted the time of the total lunar eclipse that occurred on 7th Nov 477 CE. Ratnadeva II defeated the Kaliôga king Anantavarman Choçagaôga and his feudatory Gokarõa (Yaœchoçagaôga-Gokarõau yudhi cakre paraôgmukhau).106 It may be noted that the inscriptions of Anantavarman Choçagaôga are dated in the Œaka era (583 BCE) and he ruled around 417-489 CE. Prithvideva II was the son of Ratnadeva II and his earliest grant is dated in Kalachuri year 890 (487 CE).107 Interestingly, his Ratanpur stone inscription is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1207 (488 CE).108 JÀjalladeva II, the son of Prithvideva II ascended the throne around Kalachuri year 916 (513 CE) and on his untimely demise, was succeeded by his elder brother Jagaddeva and he, in turn, was succeeded by his son Ratnadeva III whose son PratÀpamalla ascended the throne after\n277 him. PratÀpamalla’s Pendrabandh grant is dated in Kalachuri year 965(562 CE)109 and Bilaigarh grant in Kalachuri year 969 (566 CE).110 The chronology of the Kalachuris of South Kosala: Kalachuri-Chedi era (403-402 BCE) In CE KaliôgarÀja 725-750 322-347 CE KamalarÀja 750-795 347-392 CE Ratnadeva I 795-820 392-417 CE Prithvideva I 820-840 417-437 CE JÀjalladeva I 840-866 437-463 CE Ratnadeva II 866-889 463-486 CE Prithvideva II 889-915 486-512 CE JÀjalladeva II 916-920 513-517 CE Jagaddeva 920-930 517-527 CE Ratnadeva III 930-950 527-547 CE PratÀpamalla 950-970 547-567 CE We have no information about the immediate successors of PratÀpamalla. It is quite likely that the rule of this family of the Kalachuris ended with PratÀpamalla due to the rise of the YÀdava dynasty. The Bilaigarh grant of PratÀpamalla is the last grant dated in Kalachuri era thereby suggesting that the use of the Kalachuri era ended with the downfall of the Kalachuris of Ratanpur. There is no instance of the use of the Kalachuri-Chedi era after the 6th century CE. The knowledge of the epoch of Kalachuri-Chedi era faded away from public memory by the 11th century CE and therefore, Alberuni had no knowledge of it. It appears that the descendants of this Kalachuri family of Ratanpur re-established themselves in the beginning of the 8th century CE. The Ratanpur stone inscription111 of the Kalachuri king VÀhara is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year in 1552 (833 CE) and the Kosgain stone inscription No. 2112 is dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1570 (851 CE). According to Kosgain inscription No. 2, Ghatama was the feudatory of the Kalachuri king VÀhara. Kosgain inscription No. 1 tells us that Kalachuri king VÀhara’s minister MÀdhava completely destroyed all enemies, snatched away the royal fortune of the enemies, defeated the PathÀõas in the battle, wrested away the territory of PathÀõas and brought away camels, gold, other metals, elephants, horses, innumerable THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n278 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA cows and female buffaloes. Seemingly, MÀdhava also defeated the ruler of Sindh (°dau jitvÀ Sindhu_li_maulim...). Such victories of MÀdhava cannot be explained if the inscriptions of VÀhara are dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). Therefore, the inscriptions of the Kalachuri king VÀhara are dated in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and he flourished in 9th century CE. The Raipur inscription113 of RÀya-Brahmadeva is dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1458 (1400-1401 CE) and ŒÀlivÀhana 1322 elapsed (1400-1401 CE). This inscription was engraved on the 8thtithi of the bright fortnight of PhÀlguna month. King RÀya-Brahmadeva was referred to as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and Rayapur was his capital. Most probably, RÀya- Brahmadeva was not a Kalachuri king. The Khallari temple inscription114 of Hari-Brahmadeva, dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1470 (1412-1413 CE) and ŒÀlivÀhana 1334 elapsed (1412-1413 CE), states that the Kalachuri king Siôghaõa conquered 18 of his enemies’ forts (Nija-Bhuja-guru-darpÀdyo’ri-durgÀnyajaiÈit-raõa-bhuvi daœa cÀÈÇau Siôghaõa-kœoõipÀlah....). King Siõghaõa’s son was Ramadeva and the grandson Haribrahmadeva whose capital was KhalvÀÇikÀ known as KhallÀri in modern times. Evidently, Hari-Brahmadeva was a Kalachuri king and cannot be the same as RÀya-Brahmadeva. The Kalachuris of Kuœinagara The branch of the Kalachuris of Kuœinagara is known from the Kasia stone inscription which is not dated but possibly belonged to the 5th century CE.115 King Œaôkaragaõa was the earliest known king of this family and is quite likely one of the eighteen sons of Kokalladeva I. The genealogy of Kalachuris of Kuœinagara: 1. Œankaragaõa 2. NannarÀja 3. Lakœmaõa I 4. ŒivarÀja I 5. BhimaÇa I 6. Lakœmaõa II 7. ŒivarÀja II 8. (Name lost) 9. Lakœmaõa III 10. BhÁmaÇa II (5th century)\n279 The Kalachuris of SarayÂpÀra The Kahla grant116 of Soçhadeva, dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1135 (1078 CE), is the only source of information about the Kalachuri family of SarayÂpÀra and it is evident from the grant that the Kalachuri king VyÀsa, the son of GuõasÀgara, re-established his kingdom and made the city of GokulaghaÇÇa his capital on the 8th tithi of the bright fortnight of the second JyeÈÇha month in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama 1087 i.e. 31st May 1031 CE. King VyÀsa’s son Soçhadeva issued the Kahla grant on the 7th tithi of the bright fortnight of PauÈa month on the occasion of UttarÀyaõa SaÚkrÀnti i.e. 24th Dec 1077 CE. Kahla grant tells us that the earliest king of the Kalachuri family of SarayÂpÀra was LakœmaõarÀja who was the younger brother of Kalachuritilaka (the ornament of Kalachuris). It is probable that, the epithet “Kalachuritilaka” was applied to Kokalladeva I as he appears to have conquered the country of “ŒvetapÀda” and given it to his brother LakœmaõarÀja. LakœmaõarÀja was succeeded by his son King RÀjaputra; he, in turn, by his son ŒivarÀja, and he, in turn, was succeded by his son Œaôkaragaõa whose son GuõÀÚbhodhideva was a contemporary of ParamÀra Bhojadeva and received some territory from Bhojadeva. UllÀbha succeeded his father GuõÀÚbhodhideva and UllÀbha’s half- brother BhÀmaõadeva ascended the throne after him. BhÀmaõadeva, who was probably a contemporary of the DhÀrÀ king ParamÀra Naravarman, defeated the forces of the king of DhÀrÀ. Soçhadeva’s grant dated in ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era 1135 (1078 CE) is strong evidence in itself that the great ParamÀra king Bhojadeva cannot be dated around 1010-1060 CE. According to this grant, GuõÀÚbhodhideva was a contemporary of Bhoja. After GuõÀÚbhodhideva, seven kings from UllÀbha to Bhima flourished. After the reign of Bhima, the Kalachuris of SarayÂpÀra lost their kingdom. Later, GuõasÀgara II re-established the kingdom of the Kalachuris and Soçhadeva was his grandson. Soçhadeva’s father Vyasa made the city of GokulaghaÇÇa as his capital in 1031 CE. It is impossible to explain the history of the Kalachuris of SarayÂpÀra from GuõÀÚbhodhideva to Soçhadeva between 1060 CE to 1078 CE. Therefore, ParamÀra Bhoja and THE EPOCH OF THE SRI HARSHA ERA AND KALACHURI-CHEDI ERA\n280 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA \u0002 Kalachuri GuõÀÚbhodhideva flourished in the 4th century CE whereas Soçhadeva ruled in the 11th century CE. Some historians argued that GuõÀÚbhodhideva was a contemporary of Pratihara Bhoja not Paramara Bhoja. It may be noted that the Kalachuri king Kokalladeva gave protection to Pratihara Bhoja. Therefore, it is highly improbable that a king of Kalachuris became a feudatory of Pratiharas. Undoubtedly, GuõÀÚbhodhideva was a contemporary of Paramara Bhoja. Moreover, Soçhadeva, the sovereign Kalachuri king, preferred to use Vikrama era instead of Kalachuri-Chedi era which also indicates that the Kalachuri-Chedi era was not in use by the time of Soçhadeva.

Their immense passion to solve astronomical problems led to numerous discoveries in Mathematics and Astronomy. Ancient Indians developed mathematical astronomy by meticulous and painstaking multi-generational record-keeping of astronomical observations and finding solutions for astronomical problems through mathematical manipulations. Truly speaking, India was the birth place of astronomy and mathematics and taught the basics of these sciences to the rest of the world. Indian astronomy is much older than Babylonian, Egyptian and Hellenistic astronomy. John Playfair (1748-1819 CE), a Scottish mathematician, demonstrated that the epoch of the astronomical observations recorded in the tables by Hindu astrologers had to be 4300 BCE. Evidently, ancient Indians knew the importance of using the epoch for astronomical calculations which evolved the concept of eras. Some intellectually challenged historians claimed that ancient Indians were not accustomed to the use of eras and only foreigners introduced eras in India. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Indians used eras since ancient times. The Greek historians Pliny and Arrian (95-175 CE) mention that Indians used the SaptarÈi calendar that commenced in 6676 BCE. Alberuni records that Hindus had an era called KÀlayavana with the epoch at the end of last DvÀparayuga.1 Most probably, the epoch of KÀlayavana era may have commenced at a date earlier than the epoch of the Kaliyuga era and the MahÀbhÀrata war but unfortunately no literary or archaeological evidence is available today. Let us discuss the epoch of various Indian eras that unravel the mysteries of the chronology of ancient Indian history",

Some scholars concluded that the MahÀbhÀrata war occurred 36 years before the epoch of Kaliyuga i.e. 3102 BCE. Thus, the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war can be fixed at 3138 BCE. The Aihole inscription2 of the early Chalukya Pulakeœin II dated in Œaka 556 elapsed (27-26 BCE) explicitly mentions that 30+3000+100+5 = 3135 years elapsed up to 28-27 BCE from the year of MahÀbhÀrata war; that means 3135+27 = 3162 BCE was the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war. Western historians distorted the statement of the Aihole inscription “SahÀbda-œata-yukteÈu” into “SaptÀbda-œata-yukteÈu” and calculated that 30+3000+700+5 = 3735 years elapsed and not 3135 years. Considering the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) as Œaka era (583 BCE), they calculated the year 3102 BCE [3735-(556 +78) = 3102] and concluded that RavikÁrti, the author of the Aihole inscription, referred to the epoch of the Kaliyuga era as the epoch of the MahÀbhÀrata war. None of the Indian literary sources refer to the epochal year of Kaliyuga as the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war. If we consider the reading “SaptÀbda-œata-yukteÈu” as the correct version, it must be interpreted as 7+100 = 107 and not as 7 x 100 = 700. Therefore, the Aihole inscription tells us that 3135 or 3142 years elapsed from “BhÀratÀt ÀhavÀt” meaning the war of BhÀratas i.e. MahÀbhÀrata war. Thus, the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war was 3162 or 3169 BCE according to the Aihole inscription. Interestingly, Bhishma Parva (3.29) of Mahabharata mentions the rare occurrence of two eclipses (solar & lunar) within thirteen days (less than 14 days) in Kurukshetra before the Mahabharata war. “CaturdaœÁm paðcadaœÁm bhutapÂrvÀm ca ÈodaœÁm, ImÀm tu nÀbhijÀnÀmi amÀvÀsyÀm trayodaœÁm || CandrasÂryÀvubhau grastÀvekamÀse trayodaœÁm, Aparvaõi grahÀvetau prajÀÍ saÚkœapayiÈyataÍ || RajovÃtÀ diœaÍ sarvÀÍ pÀôsuvarÈaiÍ samantataÍ, UtpÀtameghÀ raudrÀœca rÀtrau varÈanti œoõitam || ”\n283 It is stated, “I knew about the occurrence of Amavasya i.e. New Moon day on the 14th, 15th or 16th day but I don’t know about that occurring on the 13th day. Both Solar and lunar eclipses occurred back to back on 13th day in a single lunar month”. Dr. S Balakrishna of NASA calculated the eclipses considering the location of Kurukshetra and concluded that a pair of eclipses occurred in August 3128 BCE (Julian year 3129 BC). An Annular solar eclipse occurred on 11th Aug 3128 BCE and a partial lunar eclipse occurred on 25th Aug 3128 BCE. Thus, both eclipses occurred within 13 days, 20 hours and 20 minutes. Mausala Parva (2.19 to 2.20) of the Mahabharata also mentions the occurrence of a solar eclipse at the city of Dwaraka in the 36th year (elapsed) of the Mahabharata war. An annular solar eclipse occurred on 22nd Aug 3091 BCE and was visible from the city of Dwaraka. In view of the above, the date of the MahÀbhÀrata war cannot be fixed later than 3128 BCE. Since the Aihole inscription indicates the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war to be 3162 or 3169 BCE with reference to the epoch of the Saka era in 583 BCE, undoubtedly, the Mahabharata war must have occurred between 3169 BCE and 3128 BCE. The YudhiÈÇhira era (3128 BCE or 3109 BCE) VarÀhamihira states in the BÃhat SaÚhitÀ that SaptarÈis (Great Bear) were in the constellation of MaghÀ during the reign of YudhiÈÇhira.3 VarÀhamihira refers to the following verse from Garga SaÚhitÀ of VÃddha Garga: “°san MaghÀsu munayaÍœÀsati pÃthvÁm YudhiÈÇhire nÃpatau | Øaç-dvika-paðcha-dvi-yutaœ-œakakÀlaÍ tasya rÀjðaœca|| ”4 “The Great Bear (munayaÍ = SaptarÈis) was in the constellation of MaghÀ, when king YudhiÈÇhira ruled the Earth; the interval between the YudhiÈÇhira kÀla and the Œaka kÀla was 2526 years.” Œaka era (the coronation of Œaka king) commenced in 583 BCE as explained in detail in",

Therefore, it is evident that YudhiÈÇhira was ruling around 3109 BCE and the Great Bear was in MaghÀ AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n284 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA constellation. Most probably, 3109 BCE was the epoch of YudhiÈÇhira era. It appears that the siddhÀnta followed by VÃddha Garga used the epoch of YudhiÈÇhira era for astronomical calculations. Interestingly, the date of VÃddha Garga can also be fixed between the beginning year of Œaka era i.e. 583 BCE and before the birth of VarÀhamihira i.e. Œaka 427 (156 BCE). Most probably, VÃddha Garga flourished around 500 BCE. According to KD Abhyankar and GM Ballabh,5 VÃddha Garga lived around 500 BCE and had the knowledge of the rate of precession of 1o per 100 years. In 500 BCE, the summer solstice used to occur at nirayana longitude ë (285) = 100o according to ChitrÀ-pakœa. Then, using VÃddha Garga’s rate of precession of 1o per century, we find that in 3100 BCE the summer solstice would have been at the nirayana longitude 126o, which corresponds with MaghÀ constellation. This explains how VÃddha Garga came to the conclusion that the SaptarÈis were in MaghÀ during the reign of YudhiÈÇhira. The Greeks evidently borrowed the knowledge of the rate of precession of 1o per 100 years from Indian sources. YudhiÈÇhira was coronated in Indraprastha immediately after the MahÀbhÀrata war. Since the MahÀbhÀrata war occurred around 3128 BCE, the same year must be the epoch of the YudhiÈÇhira era. There is no direct or indirect evidence to prove that YudhiÈÇhira founded an era. It is very likely that YudhiÈÇhira’s grandson Janamejaya started this era in commemoration of YudhiÈÇhira’s coronation or nirvÀõa. Interestingly, two grants6 of King Janamejaya dated in the year 89 of the YudhiÈÇhira era were found. The Jaisalmer VaiÈõava temple inscription7of MÂlarÀja refers to the year 4898 of YudhiÈÇhira era but evidently this inscription uses the Kaliyuga era which is referred to as YudhiÈÇhira era erroneously. ChitsukhÀchÀrya, the author of BÃhat Œaôkara Vijaya, used the YudhiÈÇhira era in his treatise. According to him, °di ŒaôkarÀchÀrya attained nirvÀõa in the year 2646 of the YudhiÈÇhira era.8 Jaina and Buddhist scholars also used the YudhiÈÇhira era but there is no further information to fix the exact epoch of the YudhiÈÇhira era as intended by these scholars. However, it is evident that the YudhiÈÇhira era was in use before the introduction of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and Œaka\n285 era (583 BCE). According to VÃddha Garga and VarÀhamihira, the epoch of the YudhiÈÇhira era was 2526 years before the Œaka era (583 BCE) i.e. 3109 BCE. The Kaliyuga era (3102 BCE) Ancient Indian astronomers evolved the concept of Yugas or MahÀyugas to facilitate accurate astronomical calculations in integral numbers. Though they understood the basics of fractions, they preferred to deal with large numbers to avoid complications. Thus, the MahÀyuga concept became the essential feature of Indian astronomy. According to °ryabhaÇa, Kaliyuga started at midnight between 17th and 18th Feb 3102 BCE and it was a Friday. The two inscriptions of the early Chalukya Vishnuvardhana are the earliest inscriptions dated in the year of Kaliyuga 2625 (477 BCE) and 2628 (474 BCE).9 The SaptarÈi SaÚvat or Laukika era or ŒÀstra KÀla (6676 BCE or 3076 BCE) Ancient Indians were the first to discover that SaptarÈis i.e. the Great Bear resided one hundred years in one nakœatra constellation while completing one cycle of 27 nakœatras in 2700 years. They used the cycle of SaptarÈi as a calendar. Greek historians mention that Indians used the SaptarÈi calendar with the epoch in 6676 BCE. The SaptarÈi era was also known as the Laukika era and sometimes the “ŒÀstra-KÀla”. This era was used in the PurÀõas, in the history of Nepal and in the RÀjataraôgiõÁ of Kalhaõa. Epigraphic evidence indicates that the SaptarÈi era was in use in Kashmir and its neighbourhood. At the time of Alberuni (1018-1030 CE), it was also in use in Multan. It appears that initially the epoch of the SaptarÈi era was in 6676 BCE as mentioned by Greek historians but later, Kashmiri astronomers appear to have reset the calendar of SaptarÈis from the year 3076 BCE. Though, the SaptarÈi era consists of cycles of 2700 years, in practice the hundreds are omitted, and as soon as the reckoning reaches 100, a fresh hundred begins from 1. The earliest inscription dated in the SaptarÈi era was found at Baijnath, Himachal Pradesh written in the ŒÀradÀ script.10 This Baijnath Praœasti is dated in the 80th year of the SaptarÈi era and Œaka 7xx. The Œaka year mentioned must be 786 elapsed (203-204 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n286 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA CE) considering the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king (583 BCE).Western historians assumed the year of this inscription as 726 with reference to the epoch of the death of Œaka king (78 CE) The era of Buddha NirvÀõa (2134 BCE or 1658 BCE) Ancient Buddhist literature refers to the epoch of the MahÀparinirvÀõa of Gautama Buddha for dating certain historical events but opinions differ as to the exact date of the nirvÀõa of Buddha. Let us first shortlist the essential data from various sources related to Buddha’s nirvÀõa. \u0002 It is well known fact that Buddha flourished before the rule of the Nandas and Mauryas in Magadha. The PurÀõas record that MahÀpadmananda ascended the throne after 1500 years from the birth of King ParÁkœit. Thus, the nirvÀõa of Buddha cannot be dated earlier than 17th century BCE. Kota Venkatachalam fixed the date of nirvÀõa in 1807 BCE whereas Dr. DS Triveda proved it in 1793 BCE. \u0002 Many Buddhist sources (Sanskrit and Tibetan) including Vinayapitaka inform us that the difference between the date of Aœoka’s coronation and the nirvÀõa of Buddha was 100 years. \u0002 According to Buddhist chronicles like DÁpavaÚœa, MahÀvaÚœa and SamantapÀsÀdikÀ, King Aœoka’s consecration is dated 218 years after the nirvÀõa of Buddha and the council of RÀjagÃha was held 18 years later i.e. 236 years after nirvÀõa of Buddha.11 \u0002 The Khotanese chronicle, Li yul gyi lo rgyus, places the start of the reign of Aœoka 234 years after nirvÀõa of Buddha.12 \u0002 The northern Buddhist tradition places the nirvÀõa about 100 or 110 years before the coronation of Aœoka. \u0002 Buddha was a contemporary of BimbisÀra and AjÀtaœatru. According to Buddhist tradition, Buddha was 72 years old at the time of AjÀtaœatru’s coronation. \u0002 Max Muller collected 14 dates referring to Buddha’s nirvÀõa from Tibetan sources. They range from 2422 BCE to 546 BCE.13 \u0002 Chinese scholar Fahien, who visited India in the fifth century\n287 (405-411 CE), recorded that 1497 years elapsed since the nirvÀõa of Buddha. Thus, the date of NirvÀõa can be fixed around 1086 BCE. \u0002 Hiuen Tsang stated that the Chinese were not able to attribute an exact date to the nirvÀõa of Buddha during his times (7th century CE). However, he referred to various dates from 860 BCE to 260 BCE. \u0002 Tao Hsuan referred to the tradition of “dotted record” in his work Ta t’ang nei tien lu and claimed that when UpÀli collated the Vinaya after the nirvÀõa of Buddha, he marked a dot in the manuscript. His successors like DÀsaka, Sonaka, Siggava, Moggaliputta, Tissa and Chandavajji marked a new dot each year. During a visit to Canton about 489 CE, Saôghabhadra inscribed the 975th dot on the manuscript. Thus, Cantonese sources place the nirvÀõa in 486 BCE.14 \u0002 Some of the sources from Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia place the nirvÀõa around 543 BCE. \u0002 Later Jain tradition claims that Mahavira was a contemporary of Buddha. \u0002 Some of the sources from Sri Lanka and China place the nirvÀõa in 483 BCE. \u0002 Apart from the above, SaÚyutta NikÀya gives certain verifiable astronomical details related to the year of nirvÀõa of Buddha. According to SaÚyutta NikÀya, Buddha was staying in ŒrÀvastÁ about three months before his death. During this time, three events were observed: the winter solstice and a lunar eclipse, followed by a solar eclipse.15 It is evident from the above that the date of MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha cannot be arrived at without fixing the date of king Aœoka’s accession and consecration. Modern historians generally agree that Buddha attained nirvÀõa in 486 BCE or 483 BCE and Aœoka ascended the throne in 268 BCE or 265 BCE. There is unanimity on the point that Buddha lived for eighty years. Thus, Buddha was born in 566 BCE or 563 BCE.

The chronology of the Maurya dynasty given by eminent historians is highly distorted and hence not acceptable. According to the PurÀõas, MahÀpadmananda ascended the throne 1500 years after the birth of ParÁkœit and the Great Bear (SaptarÈis) was in Œravaõa constellation during the reign of king Nanda. “MahÀpadmÀbhiÈekÀttu yÀvajjanma ParÁkœitaÍ| ekameva sahasram tu jðeyam paðca-œatottaram|| ”16 “SaptarÈayo MaghÀyuktÀÍ kÀle YaudhiÈÇhire œatam | Œravaõe te bhaviÈyanti kÀle nandasya bhÂpateÍ|| ”17 The Great Bear was in Œravaõa constellation during the period 1676- 1577 BCE and it is well known that king ParÁkœit, the son of Abhimanyu was born in the year of the MahÀbhÀrata war. As discussed above, the date of the MahÀbhÀrata war can be fixed around 3128 BCE. MahÀpadmananda ascended the throne approximately 1500 years after the birth of ParÁkœit and his Nanda dynasty ruled for 100 years. Since ParÁkœit was born around 3128 BCE, MahÀpadmananda’s coronation must be dated after 1628 BCE. The Maurya dynasty succeeded the Nandas. According to PurÀõas and Buddhist sources, Chandragupta reigned for 34 years, BindusÀra for 28 years and Aœoka for 37 years. Buddhist sources tell us that Buddha attained nirvÀõa100 years or 218 years before Aœoka’s consecration. SaÚyutta NikÀya tells us that Buddha was staying in ŒrÀvastÁ about three months before his death. During this time, there occurred the winter solstice and a lunar eclipse followed by a solar eclipse. It clearly indicates that the lunar and solar eclipses occurred within 15 days and were visible in India. ŒrÀvasti is situated 27.31 north latitude and 82.32 east longitude. Based on the astronomical details given in the SaÚyutta NikÀya, only 1807-06 BCE, 1694-03 BCE and 1659-58 BCE can qualify as the intended years but the solar eclipses that occurred on 10th Feb 1806 BCE, 2nd Feb 1694 BCE and 22nd Jan 1693 BCE were not visible in India. However, the penumbral lunar eclipse which occurred on 9th Feb 1658 BCE and the solar eclipse which occurred on 23rd Feb 1658 BCE were visible in ŒrÀvastÁ and elsewhere in India. The winter solstice also occurred in the first\n289 week of January 1658 BCE. Therefore, Buddha attained MahÀparinirvÀõa in Kuœinagar on VaiœÀkha PÂrõimÀ i.e. 9th April 1658 BCE. Accordingly, Buddha was born on VaiœÀkha PÂrõimÀ i.e. 25th March 1738 BCE and lived for eighty years. The PurÀõas tell us that Buddha was the son of Œuddhodana, a king of the IkœvÀku dynasty. AjÀtaœatru was coronated king when Buddha was seventy-two years old but it is difficult to establish the identity of AjÀtaœatru as to whether he belonged to the ŒiœunÀga dynasty or some other dynasty. Now the chronology can be arrived at considering the Maurya king Aœoka’s consecration in the 218th year: \u0002 Buddha was born in 1738 BCE and attained MahÀparinirvÀõa in 1658 BCE. \u0002 MahÀpadmananda ascended the throne in 1616 BCE and founded the rule of the Nanda dynasty. Nine Nanda kings ruled for 100 years up to 1516 BCE. \u0002 Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya dynasty in 1516 BCE and ruled for 34 years up to 1482 BCE. \u0002 BindusÀra ruled for 28 years from 1482 BCE to 1454 BCE. \u0002 Aœoka or Aœokavardhana ascended the throne in 1454 BCE. The Kaliôga War occurred in his 13th regnal year i.e.1441 BCE. Aœoka was consecrated 218 years after the NirvÀõa of Buddha i.e.1440 BCE. \u0002 The Buddhist council at RÀjagÃha was convened in 1422 BCE, 18 years after Aœoka’s consecration. According to Milinda-Panho, the Yavana king Milinda of ŒÀkala (Sialkot?) flourished 500 years after the NirvÀõa of Buddha. Thus, the lifetime of Milinda can be fixed in the 12th century BCE. Western historians held that Yavanas meant Greeks or Indianised Greeks and wrongly identified the Yavana king Milinda with Minander (165-130 BCE). Actually, Yavanas have existed in the Western and /or North- Western borders of India prior to the birth of ancient Greek civilisation. I have discussed this issue in detail in",

AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n290 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA One inscription found at GayÀ is dated in the year 1813 of Buddha nirvÀõa era. This inscription mentions Aœokachalla, a king of the SapÀdalakœa mountains (PrakhyÀtam hi sapÀdalakœa-œikhari-kœmÀpÀla- cÂçÀmaõim œÁlaiÍ Œrimad-Aœokachallamapi yo natvÀ vinÁya svayam|).18A Bodh GayÀ inscription dated in the year 74 of Lakœmaõasena SaÚvat refers to Daœaratha, the younger brother of the king Aœokachalla (SapÀdalakœa- œikhari-kœmÀpÀla rÀjÀdhirÀja-Œrimad-Aœokachalladeva-kaniÈÇha-bhrÀtÃ-Œri- Daœaratha-nÀmadheya-kumÀra-pÀdapadmopajÁvÁ......).19 Undoubtedly, both inscriptions belonged to the time of king Aœokachalla. The Bisapi grant of the time of ŒivasiÚhadeva20 is dated in the year 293 of Lakœmaõasena era, in KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama year 1455 elapsed (10th Oct 736 CE to 28th Sep 737 CE) and in Œaka 1321 current (7th Mar 737 CE to 23rd Feb 738 CE). Considering the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era in 719-718 BCE and the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king in 583 BCE, the Bisapi grant was issued on the 7th tithi of the bright fortnight of ŒrÀvaõa month i.e. 9th July 737 CE. Now we can easily calculate the epoch of Lakœmaõasena SaÚvat which commenced 293 years before the year 737 CE i.e. 443-444 CE. Thus, the Bodh Gaya inscription of the time of king Aœokachalla dated in Lakœmaõasena era 74 was issued in 517-518 CE. Considering that the regnal year (517-518 CE) of king Aœokachalla and the year 1813 of Buddha nirvÀõa era mentioned in the Gaya inscription are the same, the year of NirvÀõa of Buddha works out to be 1296 BCE. The astronomical data given by the SaÚyutta NikÀya can only be verified with reference to the year 1250 BCE but it is contrary to the astronomical data provided by the PurÀõas (The great Bear was in ŒrÀvaõa constellation during the reign of Nandas). Historians identified the Aœoka mentioned in the Buddhist literary sources as the Maurya king Aœoka. Interestingly, there was a king of Kashmir named Aœoka who flourished in a period before the Maurya king Aœoka. According to RÀjataraôgiõÁ, a Kashmir king Aœoka was a follower of the Buddha. Jaloka and DÀmodara II succeeded him, and thereafter, the TuruÈka kings HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka started ruling in Kashmir around 150 years elapsed from the nirvÀõa of Buddha. Thus, the Kashmir king Aœoka may have flourished around the 100th year from\n291 the nirvÀõa of Buddha. Many Buddhist sources (Sanskrit and Tibetan) say the difference between the date of Aœoka’s coronation and the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha is 100 years. VinayapiÇaka tells us that the Buddhist council of VaiœÀli was held in the 100th year from the nirvÀõa of Buddha, just before the reign of DharmÀœoka.

    "content": ". Kalhaõa wrote RÀjataraôgiõÁ in Saka 1070 (487 CE) and provided the history of Kashmir up to the 25th year of Laukika era i.e. 449 CE. According to him, Gonanda III started ruling 2330 years before 449 CE i.e. around 1881 BCE. Kashmir Kings Aœoka, Jaloka, DÀmodara II, HuÈka, JuÈka, KaniÈka and Abhimanyu ruled prior to Gonanda III. Undoubtedly, the Kashmir king Aœoka was coronated at least 150 years before Gonanda III. Interestingly, Atiœa DÁpÀnkar ŒrijðÀna (319-391 CE), an Indian Buddhist scholar from Bengal (during the PÀla Empire) who was instrumental in reviving Buddhism in Tibet, mentions that Buddha attained MahÀparinirvÀõa in 2136 BCE. According to Tibetan VajrayÀna Buddhist Sa-skya-pa scholars, there is a span of 2955 years from the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha up to 822 CE in which the peace treaty between Tibet and China was concluded; a span of 3300 years up to 1167 CE in which the work entitled “Char-la- jug-pal-ngo” was written and there is a span of 3349 years up to 1216 CE when Grags-pa-rgynl-mtshan passed away. Thus, the tradition of Sa-skya- pa scholars tells us that Buddha attained MahÀparinirvÀõa around 2134- 2133 BCE. They fix the date of the birth of Buddha around 2213 (Earth- Dragon year) and the date of nirvÀõa on the boundary of 2134 BCE (Fire- Pig year) & 2133 BCE (Earth-Mouse year). According to another Tibetan tradition, Buddha attained nirvÀõa around 2422-2421 BCE. Most probably, the King Aœoka mentioned in Buddhist sources was a Kashmir King who flourished in a period prior to the Maurya King Aœoka. RÀjataraôgiõÁ clearly informs us that the Kashmiri King Aœoka was a Buddhist whereas PurÀõas mention nothing about the Maurya King Aœoka as being a patron of Buddhism. In my opinion, the Kashmir king Aœoka and Maurya Aœoka were not only two different persons but also belonged to two different eras. The Kashmir King Aœoka was AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n292 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA coronated in the 100th year from the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha and HuÈka, JuÈka, KaniÈka started ruling in Kashmir in 150th year from the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha. Most probably, Buddha attained nirvÀõa in 2134-2133 BCE as mentioned by Buddhist scholar Atiœa and Tibetan Sa- skya-pa tradition. If the Aœoka of Buddhist literature was a Maurya king, Buddha ought to have attained MahÀparinirvÀõa in Kuœinagar on VaiœÀkha PÂrõimÀ of 1658 BCE i.e. 9th April 1658 BCE. At least, it is now certain that the MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha cannot be dated later than 1658 BCE. In my opinion, the traditional account of Tibetan Sa-skya-pa scholars seems more authentic because the Asoka mentioned in ancient Buddhist literature was probably a king of Kashmir who flourished around 2034-2000 BCE as recorded in RÀjataraôgiõÁ of Kalhaõa. Therefore, Buddha attained MahÀparinirvÀõa in Kuœinagar on VaiœÀkha PÂrõimÀ of 2134 BCE i.e. 23rd Mar 2134 BCE. The era of Mahavira NirvÀõa (1189 BCE) Jaina PaÇÇÀvalÁs and Jaina literary sources used the epoch of Mahavira nirvÀõa for recording the historical dates.

All Jaina sources unanimously tell us that Mahavira attained nirvÀõa 605 years and 5 months before the start of the Œaka era (583 BCE) and 470 years before the start of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). According to Guõabhadra’s UttarapurÀõa, Mahavira attained nirvÀõa in the month of KÀrttika, kÃÈõa pakœa chaturdaœÁ and SvÀti nakœatra. Thus, Mahavira attained nirvÀõa on 22nd October 1189-88 BCE. Let us discuss the dates mentioned with reference to the epoch of Mahavira nirvÀõa in the PaÇÇÀvalÁ of KharataragaccÍa.21 1. Mahavira was born on the 13th tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month and lived for 72 years and died on new moon day of KÀrttika month. Thus, Mahavira was born on 28th Feb 1261 BCE and attained nirvÀõa on 22ndOct 1189 BCE. 2. IndrabhÂti also known as Gautama was the first disciple of Mahavira and died 12 years after Mahavira’s nirvÀõa. Thus, IndrabhÂti died in 1177-76 BCE.\n293 3. The first Nihnava caused by JÀmÀli took place 14 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1175-74 BCE and second Nihnava by TiÈyagupta took place 16 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1173-72 BCE. 4. Sudharman, who became Kevalin for 8 years, died at the age of hundred, 20 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1169-68 BCE. 5. Jambu, who became Kevalin for 44 years, died 64 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1125-24 BCE. 6. Jaina Acharya Prabhava died 75 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1114-13 BCE. 7. Jaina Acharya Sayyambhava died 98 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1091-90 BCE. 8. Jaina Acharya Yaœobhadra died 148 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1041-40 BCE. 9. SambhÂtivijaya, who became YugapradhÀna for 8 years, died 156 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1033-32 BCE. 10. BhadrabÀhu, the last Œrutakevalin attained nirvÀõa 170 years after Mahavira nirvÀõa i.e. 1019-18 BCE at the age of 76. Thus, BhadrabÀhu was born in 1095-94 BCE. He composed KalpasÂtra and niryuktis on ten œÀstras. 11. SthÂlabhadra died 219 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 970-69 BCE at the age of 99. It is erroneously stated that Œakadala, the father of SthÂlabhadra, worked as minister in the court of the 9th Nanda king. 12. The third Nihnava named °ryakta caused by °ÈÀçhÀcÀrya took place 214 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 975-74 BCE, the fourth Nihnava named SamuccÍedika took place 220 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 969-68 BCE and the fifth Nihnava named Gaôga took place 228 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 961-60 BCE. 13. °rya MahÀgiri died 249 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 940-39 BCE. 14. Suhastin gave dÁkœÀ of Jainism to king SampÀti who began to reign in the 235th year after nirvÀõa i.e. 954-53 BCE. SuhÀstin died 265 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 924-23 BCE. 15. °rya Susthita died 313 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 876-75 BCE. He was the founder of KotikagaccÍa. AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n294 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 16. KÀlakÀcÀrya I lived around 376 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 813-812 BCE. 17. Gardabhilla became the king of Ujjain in 453rd year after nirvÀõa i.e. 736-35 BCE. He ruled for 13 years. KÀlakÀcÀrya II uprooted him with the help of Œaka kœatraps in 723 BCE. The Œakas took control of Ujjain and ruled for four years. 18. King VikramÀditya defeated the Œakas in 719 BCE and founded the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era which was initially known as KÃta or MÀlava- gaõa. This era was popular in North India till 8th century but was later replaced by the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE). Siddhasena DivÀkara gave dÁkœÀ of Jainism to VikramÀditya 470 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 719-718 BCE. 19. Vajra lived around 496-584 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 693-605 BCE. He was the last who knew the complete ten PÂrvas and he extended Jainism southward in the kingdom of Bauddhas. He was the founder of VajraœÀkhÀ. 20. The sixth Nihnava named TrairÀœikÀ caused by Rohagupta 544 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 645-44 BCE. 21. ŒatruðjayatÁrtha was demolished 570 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 619- 618 BCE. 22. The seventh Nihnava took place 584 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 605-04 BCE. 23. DigaÚbaras arose 609 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 580-79 BCE. 24. Devarddhi KœamÀœramaõa lived around 980 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 209-08 BCE. During his time, only one PÂrva was available. 25. VardhamÀna SÂri died in KV 1088 (369-68 CE). The PaÇÇÀvalÁ of TapagaccÍa also gives the chronology of early Jaina Acharyas similar to the PaÇÇÀvalÁ of KharataragaccÍa with some differences. TapagaccÍa provides some more details after MahaviranirvÀõa.22 1. Bhadragupta died 553 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 636-35 BCE, °ryarakœita SÂri died 557 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 632-31 BCE and Œrigupta SÂri died 584 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 605-04 BCE.\n295 2. Valabhi (a branch of Jainas in Valabhi) was discontinued 845 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 344-43 BCE. According to PrabhÀvakacharita, Valabhi-Bhaôga occurred in 845th year elapsed from nirvÀõa due to the invasion of TuruÈkas (bhaôgas- TuruÈka-vihitaÍ). 3. KÀlakÀcÀrya III lived around 993 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 196-95 BCE. 4. Satyamitra died 1000 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 189-88 BCE and at the same time, the last PÂrva was also lost. 5. Haribhadra SÂri died 1055 year after nirvÀõa or in KV 585 i.e. 134-33 BCE. 6. Jinabhadragaõi KœamÀœramaõa lived 1115 or 1150 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 74-73 BCE or 39-38 BCE. According to KharataragaccÍa, ŒÁlÀôka was the disciple of Jinabhadragaõi who composed vÃttis on the 1st and 2nd Aôgas. 7. Raviprabha erected a temple to NeminÀtha at Naddulapura 1170 years after nirvÀõa or in KV 700 i.e. 19-18 BCE. 8. UmÀsvÀti, probably, the author of bhÀÈya on the TattvÀrthÀdhigama SÂtra, lived 1190 years after nirvÀõa i.e. 1-2 CE. 9. VanarÀja founded the city of Anahillapura (AnhilwÀd) 1272 years after nirvÀõa or in KV 802 i.e. 83-82 CE. According to VicÀraœreõi of Merutuôga (644 CE), VanarÀja built the city of Anhilapura on the 2ndtithi of the bright fortnight of VaiœÀkha month in KV 821 i.e. 7th April 102 CE. 10. BappabhaÇÇi SÂri was born 1270 years after nirvÀõa or on the 3rd tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in KV 800 (15th Aug 82 CE) and died 1365 years after nirvÀõa or on 6th tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in KV 895 (17th Aug 177 CE). 11. Udyotana SÂri lived 1464 years after nirvÀõa or in KV 994 (275- 76 CE). According to KharataragaccÍa, VardhamÀna SÂri, the pupil of Udyotana, died in KV 1088 (369-68 CE). AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n296 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the later Jaina Acharyas is given in Vikrama SaÚvat in the PaÇÇÀvalÁs of KharataragaccÍa and TapagaccÍa. We have to segregate these dates with reference to the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama and ChaitrÀdi Vikrama eras to arrive at the exact dates in Common Era. According to the ŒvetÀmbara tradition, BhadrabÀhu III recompiled the KalpasÂtra of BhadrabÀhu I and wrote the niryuktis on °gamasÂtras 980 or 993 years after nirvÀõa (209 or 196 BCE) during the reign of Maitraka king Dhruvasena. It is also believed that BhadrabÀhu was like an elder brother to VarÀhamihira. King Dhruvasena ruled around 150- 109 BCE and VarÀhamihira flourished around 156-74 BCE. Most probably, the year 980 or 993 mentioned was the birth year of BhadrabÀhu III and he was the senior contemporary of king Dhruvasena and VarÀhamihira. All Jaina sources clearly tell us that Mahavira attained nirvÀõa 470 years before the time of VikramÀditya (719-718 BCE) and 605 years and 5 months before the start of the Œaka era (583 BCE). Therefore, the date of Mahavira nirvÀõa can be conclusively fixed on 22nd October 1189-88 BCE. Western historians concluded that Mahavira’s nirvÀõa occurred in 467 BCE based on the mistaken identity of Chandragupta. Actually, Hemachandra (5th century CE) who flourished during the reign of the Chaulukya king JayasiÚha (433-480 CE) and KumÀrapÀla (480-510 CE), mistakenly identified the King Chandragupta of Ujjain, the disciple of BhadrabÀhu I with the Maurya king Chandragupta of PÀtaliputra. HarivaÚœa of JinasenasÂri (122 CE) relates the chronology of various dynasties that ruled after MahaviranirvÀõa but does not mention the name of the Maurya dynasty at all. It is evident that the Mauryas flourished before the MahaviranirvÀõa. The Chandragupta of Ujjain became king 155 or 215 years after nirvÀõa (1034 BCE or 974 BCE). Hemachandra himself mentions that SiÚhasena was the son of Chandragupta whereas the Maurya Chandragupta’s son was BindusÀra, not SiÚhasena. Therefore, the Maurya king Chandragupta cannot be identified as the disciple of BhadrabÀhu I. Maurya Chandragupta ascended the throne around 1516 BCE whereas Chandragupti or\n297 Chandragupta became the king of Ujjain 155 or 215 years after nirvÀõa (1034 BCE or 974 BCE). The KÃta or MÀlava-gaõa or KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) The era of VikramÀditya earlier known as “KÃta” and “MÀlava-gaõa” commenced in Sep-Oct 719 BCE. The calendar of this era was KÀrttikÀdi. Later, another Vikrama era, which followed the ChaitrÀdi calendar, was introduced with the epoch in 57 BCE. The epoch of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era has already been discussed in",

The NÀndsÀ (Udaypur, Rajasthan) Pillar inscription23 of Œaktiguõaguru is the earliest inscription dated in the year of KÃta or KV 282 (437 BCE) whereas probably, the second part of Vadnagar Praœasti24 is the last inscription dated in KV 1689 (970 BCE). The Œaka era (583 BCE) According to Jaina sources, KÀlakÀchÀrya II brought Œaka kœatraps to dethrone Gardabhilla, the king of Ujjain in 723 BCE. The Œakas uprooted Gardabhilla and ruled Ujjain for four years before King VikramÀditya defeated them in 719 BCE and founded the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era. VikramÀditya and his four successors ruled for 135 years. The Œakas, waiting for an opportunity to settle scores with the kings of Ujjain, defeated them around 583 BCE. The Œaka king CaÈÇana was likely coronated in 583 BCE and he founded the Œaka era that commenced on 19th February 583 BCE and followed the ChaitrÀdi calendar. Thus, the epoch of the Œaka era was the coronation of the Œaka king CaÈÇana. The Badami cave inscription25 of the early Chalukya king MaôgalÁœvara clearly mentions the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king (Œaka-nÃpati- rÀjyÀbhiÈeka samvatsareœhu...). The Kurtaketi grant26 mentions a total solar eclipse that occurred in Œaka 530 i.e. 9th May 53 BCE which unambiguously leads to the epoch of Œaka era i.e. 19th Feb 583 BCE. This era has been elaborately discussed in",

The NÀlanda grant of Samudragupta32 dated in the year 5 (331 BCE) is the earliest whereas the Gokak grant of Sendraka king Indrananda33 dated in the year 845 (510 CE) is the last inscription. The GÀôgeya era (657-656 BCE) Many inscriptions found in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are dated in the GÀôgeya era. Actually, the kings of the Eastern Gaôga dynasty recorded the regnal year starting from the initial year of the establishment\n299 of their dynasty in their inscriptions which has been named as GÀôgeya era by modern historians. The Eastern Gaôgas ruled from the city of Kaliôga. Kaliôga deœa is well known from the MahÀbhÀrata era. KhÀravela’s MahÀmeghavÀhana dynasty was reigning in Kaliôga around the 13th century BCE. Seventeen inscriptions of the MÀÇharas of PiÈthÀpura found till date indicate that the MÀÇharas also ruled the Kaliôga region and the PitÃbhaktas were their contemporaries. Probably, the MÀÇharas and PitÃbhaktas ruled around the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. It is evident that the eastern Gaôgas were the successors of the MÀÇharas and PitÃbhaktas. Unfortunately, as there is no direct or indirect evidence available to fix the starting regnal year of the eastern Gaôga dynasty, we have to do so based on the solar and lunar eclipses mentioned in the inscriptions. These inscriptions are dated between the year 39 and the year 526. Interestingly, the SÀnta Bommali grant of the time of Devendravarman dated in GÀôgeya era 520 refers to the victorious reign of the Gaôga and KadaÚba dynasties (Gaôga-KadaÚba-vaÚœa-pravardhamÀna-vijaya-rÀjya- saÚvatsare paðca-œate viÚœottare....).34 It appears that the eastern Gaôgas and KadaÚbas united to fight the rise of the Chalukyas but KÁrtivarman I decisively defeated the KadaÚbas whereas probably the rise of the Maukhari king IœÀnavarman ended the rule of the eastern Gaôgas by the end of the 2nd century BCE. Thus, it can be concluded that the eastern Gaôga dynasty flourished around the 7th century BCE till the 2nd century BCE. Eminent historians wrongly identified the MadhukÀmÀrõava of the Chicacole grant35 dated in GÀôgeya era 526 with the later Gaôga king MadhukÀmÀrõava mentioned in the genealogy of Vajrahasta V and Anantavarman Choçagaôga. Evidently, historians concocted this identity to cut short the chronology of the eastern Gaôgas and the later Gaôgas. MadhukÀmÀrõava of the Chicacole grant and Devendravarman of the SÀnta Bommali grant were the sons of Anantavarman whereas the later Gaôga kings KÀmÀrõava and MadhukÀmÀrõava were the sons of Vajrahasta IV. Therefore, MadhukÀmÀrõava of the Chicacole grant was the early Gaôga king and cannot be identified with the later Gaôga king MadhukÀmÀrõava. AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n300 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Eight inscriptions of the eastern Gaôgas mention solar eclipses and two inscriptions mention lunar eclipses. Based on verifiable details of these epigraphs and considering the end of the eastern Gaôga and KadaÚba dynasties in the 2nd century BCE, the starting regnal year of the eastern Gaôga dynasty can be placed in 657-656 BCE. The calendar of GÀôgeya era was KÀrttikÀdi. 1. Madras plates of Indravarman:36 Lunar eclipse occurred on full moon day of MÀrgaœÁrÈa month in the year 128 of GÀôgeya era (529-528 BCE). The date corresponds to 29th Nov 529 BCE or 17th Nov 528 BCE. 2. Tekkali grant of Indravarman:37 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 154 of GÀôgeya era (503-502 BCE). The date corresponds to 21st June 502 BCE. 3. Lunar eclipse occurred in the year 192 of GÀôgeya era (465-464 BCE) before MÀgha month.38 The date corresponds to 11th Dec 465 BCE. 4. Santa Bommali plates of Nandavarman:39 Solar eclipse occurred before the 5th tithi of °ÈÀçha (on new moon day of JyeÈÇha month) in the year 221 of GÀôgeya era (436-435 BCE). The date corresponds to 31st May 435 BCE.\n301 5. Chicacole plates of Devendravarman:40 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 251 of GÀôgeya era (407-406 BCE). The date corresponds to 22nd May 407 BCE. 6. Alamanda plates of Anantavarman II:41 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 304 of GÀôgeya era (354-353 BCE). The date corresponds to 24th June 353 BCE. 7. Musunika plates of Devendravarman III:42 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 306 of GÀôgeya era (351-350 BCE). The date corresponds to 22ndApr 350 BCE. 8. Chicacole plates of Satyavarman:43 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 351 of GÀôgeya era (307-306 BCE). The date corresponds to 14th June 306 BCE. 9. Tekkali plates of Anantavarman:44 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 358 of GÀôgeya era (300-299 BCE). The date corresponds to 26th July 299 BCE. 10. Cheedivalasa plates of Devendravarman:45 Solar eclipse occurred in the year 397 of GÀôgeya era (260-259 BCE). The date corresponds to 4th June 259 BCE. AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n302 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The earliest inscription i.e. the Jirjingi grant of the eastern Gaôga king Indravarman I46is dated in the year 39 (618 BCE). It is quite likely that the father of Indravarman I was the founder of this dynasty. He also founded an era that was referred to as PravardhamÀna SaÚvat (GÀôgeya era). Indravarman proclaimed himself king of Trikaliôga and ruled from Dantapura. SÀmantavarman I succeeded Indravarman I. His Ponnuturu grant47 is dated in the year 64 (593 BCE). Hastivarman was the next king. His Urlam grant48 is dated in the year 80 (577 BCE). It appears that the capital was shifted to Kaliôganagara during the reign of Hastivarman. The Santa Bommali grant49dated in the year 87 (570 BCE) indicates that Indravarman II succeeded Hastivarman. Two grants50 dated in the year 128 (529 BCE) and 146 (511 BCE) reveal that Indravarma III ruled from Kaliôgapura and he was probably also known as LokÀrõava (Sri-LokÀrõavadevasya) as referred to in the Andhavaram grant51 dated in the year 133 (524 BCE). According to the Tekkali grant,52 Indravarman IV, the son of DÀnÀrõava, was reigning in Kaliôgapura and was also known as GuõÀrõava. His son Devendravarman I was reigning in the year 183 (474 BCE).53A grant found in Andhavaram tells us that Anantavarman I was on the throne in the year 216 (441 BCE).54 Anantavarman had two sons, Nandavarman and Devendravarman II. The Santa Bommali grant55 dated in the year 221 (435 BCE) was issued during the reign of Nandavarman and Chicacole grant56 dated in the year 251 was issued during the reign of Devendravarman II. The Alamanda grant57 informs\n303 us that Anantavarman II, the son of RÀjendravarman I, was ruling in the year 304 (353 BCE). RÀjendravarman II had two sons, Anantavarman II and Devendravarman III and probably both ruled at the same time from Kaliôgapura because three grants58 of Devendravarman III are dated in the year 306 (351 BCE), 308 (349 BCE) and 310 (347 BCE). Anantavarman II’s son RÀjendravarman II became YuvarÀja in the year 313 (344 BCE)59 and ruled up to the year 342 (315 BCE). Chicacole plates tell us that Satyavarman, the son of Devendravarman III, ruled in the year 351 (306 BCE).60Anantavarman II, the second son of Devendravarman III, also became king around the year 358 (299 BCE).61 According to two grants found in Kalahandi62 and Ganjam,63 Anantavarman IV, the son of BhÂpendravarman was ruling in the year 383 (274 BCE) and Devendravarman IV, the son of BhÂpendravarman, was ruling in the year 397 (259 BCE). A grant from Galavalli64 was issued in the year 393 (264 BCE) by Manujendravarman, the son of Devendravarman IV. Unfortunately, no inscriptions are available between the years 397 (259 BCE) to 520 (137 BCE). The Santa Bommali grant65 tells us that the eastern Gaôga king Devendravarman V, the son of Anantavarman V was ruling in the year 520 (137 BCE). This grant was issued by RÀõaka Dharmakhedi of the KadaÚba dynasty, the son of RÀnaka BhÁmakhedi and it refers to the unified victorious reign of the Gaôga and KadaÚba dynasties. Some historians distorted the date of the Madagrama grant issued by RÀõaka BhÁmakhedi during the reign of Devendravarman V and the Mandasa grant of Anantavarman VI and concocted the myth that these grants refer to the ŒÀlivÀhana era.66 They linked these grants to the later Gaôga kings Vajrahasta and RÀjarÀja. Undoubtedly, these grants belonged to the early Gaôga kings and cannot be linked to the later Gaôga kings. Most probably, these grants referred to the GÀôgeya era. MadhukÀmÀrõava, the second son of Anantavarman V, was ruling in the year 526 (131 BCE).67 Finally, Anantavarman VI, probably the son of MadhukÀmÀrõava, ruled in the year 550 (107 BCE).68 As no further inscriptions were found after the year 550, it can be concluded that the GÀôgeya era came to an end by 107 BCE.

Anantavarman VI 107 BCE Evidently, the kingdom of the eastern Gaôgas had weakened due to the rise of the Imperial Guptas. This is the reason why no eastern Gaôgas epigraphs are available between the year 397 to 520 (259-137 BCE). They attempted to re-establish themselves along with the KadaÚbas but the rise of the Chalukyas in the south and the rise of the Maukharis in the north finally ended the rule of the eastern Gaôgas by 107 BCE. The Imperial Guptas were ruling Kaliôga indirectly through their feudatories and the Gupta era was introduced in Kaliôga during the reign of Chandragupta II. Gradually, the Gupta era became popular and the GÀôgeya era was forgotten by the 1st century BCE. Some inscriptions dated in Gupta era 235(100 BCE), 260(75 BCE), 280 (55 BCE) and 283(52 BCE)69 provide valuable information about the royal families ruling in Orissa in the 1st century BCE. The Sumandala plates dated in Gupta era 250 (85 BCE)70 tell us that king Prithvi Vigraha was ruling the region of Kaliôga. According to the Ganjam grant dated in Gupta era 300 (35 BCE),71 king MÀdhavarÀja of Œailodbhava dynasty who was ruling in Kaliôga and he was the feudatory of the Gauda king ŒaœÀõka. Historians wrongly identified the Gauda king ŒaœÀôka to be a contemporary of the PuÈpabhÂti king Sri Harsha. The Gauda king ŒaœÀôka was ruling around 35 BCE whereas Œri Harsha flourished around 457 BCE. The Vishamagiri grant of the Gaôga king Indravarmadeva72 and a grant of the Gaôga king PÃthvÁvarmadeva,73 the son of MahÁndravarmadeva, issued from Œvetaka are not dated but it would not be wrong to infer that these grants were issued before the rise of the later Gaôgas. These Gaôga kings are referred to as the Œvetaka Gaôgas by a section of historians. AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS\n306 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The descendants of the eastern Gaôga dynasty known as the later Gaôgas re-established their kingdom in Kaliôga in the 1st century CE. According to the grant of Anantavarman Choçagaôga, KÀmÀrõava I conquered Kaliôga by defeating BÀlÀditya and ruled for 36 years at Jantavura or Dantapura. Two grants dated in Gupta era 500 (165 CE)74 were issued during the reign of Vajrahasta II. The Nadagam grant75 dated in Œaka 979 (396 CE) tells us that Vajrahasta V was coronated in Œaka 960(377 CE) on the 3rd tithi of the bright fortnight, the Sun being in VÃÈabha, Moon in RohiõÁ constellation, in the auspicious lagna of DhanuÈ and on Sunday i.e. 25th April 377 CE. According to the ViœÀkhapatnam grant76 dated in Œaka 1003 (420 CE), Anantavarman Choçagaôga was coronated in Œaka 999 (416 CE) on the 3rd tithi of the bright fortnight, the Sun being in Kumbha, Moon in RevatÁ constellation, during NÃyugma lagna and on Sunday i.e. 6th February 417 CE. The Kalachuri king of South Kosala, Ratnadeva II (463-486 CE) defeated Anantavarman Choçagaôga and his feudatory Gokarõa as claimed by Pendrabandh grant of PratÀpamalla.77 Another ViœÀkhapatnam grant78 of Anantavarman Choçagaôga gives the complete genealogy of the later Gaôgas which starts from the great Rishi Atri. Once a glorious king named KolÀhala, the son of Pragalbha, built a city called KolÀhalapura. Virochana was the son of KolÀhala and KolÀhalapura became the capital of 81 kings born after Virochana. VÁrasiÚha was the 82nd king and had five sons, KÀmÀrõava I, DÀnÀrõava, GuõÀarõava I, MÀrasiÚha and Vajrahasta I. KÀmÀrõava I conquered the Kaliôga region by defeating BÀlÀditya and founded the kingdom of the Gaôgas.

His last grant83 is dated in Œaka 1316 (733 CE) and in his 22rd regnal year. The rise of the Gajapati dynasty was the likely reason behind the downfall of the later Gaôgas. King Kapileœvaradeva was the founder of the Gajapati dynasty. Two grants of Raghudeva,84 the viceroy of Kapileœvara in RÀjamahendravaram, are dated in Œaka 1376 (793 CE) and Œaka 1378 (795 CE). Veligalani grant85 dated in Œaka 1380 (797 CE) was issued by Kapileœvara. Interestingly, this grant is trilingual as it was written in the Sanskrit, Telugu and Oriya languages. It appears that Kapileœvara was a great warrior. The Veligalani grant and Chiruvroli grant claim that Kapileœvara conquered HampÀ, DhÀrÀ, KÀlubariga (Gulbarga) and Dhilli (Delhi). “HampÀ kampamagÀt tato’dhikadharÀ DhÀrÀ ca dharÀtura- DvÀrÀKÀlubariga vimukta-turagÀ Dhilli ca Bhilli-vÃta |”86 Kapileœvara had two sons, Hamvira and PratÀpa PuruÈottamadeva. Hamvira’s Chiruvroli grant is dated in Œaka 1383 (800 CE). The Potavaram grant dated in Œaka 1412 (829 CE)87 and in the 30th regnal year tells us that the Gajapati King PratÀpa PuruÈottamadeva was Gauçeœvara (the king of Gauça) and NavakoÇi-KarõÀÇa-KÀlubarigeœvara (the king of nine crores of KarõÀÇa and KÀlubariga [Gulbarga]).The Velicherla\n309 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS grant dated in Œaka 1432 (849-850 CE)88 was issued by PratÀparudradeva, the son of PuruÈottamadeva. He was referred to as Œrimad- RÀjÀdhirÀjendra-Paðca-GauçÀdhinÀyakaÍ (king of the five regions of Gauça). Some historians wrongly identified PratÀparudra to be the contemporary king of the Vijayanagara king Œri KrishnadevarÀya and concocted that the Velicherla grant was issued in the 17th regnal year of PratÀparudra. There is no reference to the regnal year in the Velicherla grant. The chronology of the Gajapati dynasty: Œaka era (583 BCE) In CE Kapileœvaradeva 1360-1380 777-797 CE Humvira 1380-1383 797-800 CE PratÀpa PuruÈottamadeva 1383-1417 800-834 CE PratÀparudradeva 1417-1432 834- 849 CE Thus, Kaliôga has a great history right from the Mauryan era. The Eastern Gaôgas used the GÀôgeya era in their inscriptions with the starting point being in 657 BCE. The Gupta era replaced the GÀôgeya era during the period 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. The later Gaôgas and the early Gajapati kings used the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king (583 BCE) in their inscriptions. Since historians were ignorant of the epoch of the Œaka era, they simply assumed the epoch of ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) as the basis for dating the inscriptions of the later Gaôgas and Gajapatis thereby giving birth to many contradictions. According to eminent historians, Anantavarman Choçagaôga reigned around 1077-1147 CE. The inscriptions claim that he was the most powerful king in the eastern region between the GodÀvari and Gaôga Rivers. The Polasara grant dated in Kaliyuga era 4248 (1145-1146 CE)89 clearly tells us that a later Gaôga king Arkkeœvara was ruling from the city of Hingula located on the banks of Rishikulya River in Ganjam District. This grant was issued in his 24th regnal year and on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on full moon day of Magha i.e. 11th January 1145 CE. It can therefore, easily be seen that the Gaôga king Arkkeœvara reigned from 1122 CE. He was the son of PramÀdideva and the grandson of\n310 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA GuõÀrõavadeva. Interestingly, JhÀçakhança (modern Jharkhand) was also a part of Arkkeœvara’s kingdom. It certainly would have been impossible for Arkkeœvara to establish a large kingdom at the same time when one of the mightiest kings, Anantavarman Choçagaôga was ruling between the GodÀvari and the Gaôga Rivers. Moreover, Arkkeœvara established his capital in the Ganjam District which was also the capital of Choçagaôga. The fact is that Choçagaôga flourished around 416-486 CE whereas Arkkeœvara reigned around 1122-1145 CE. Therefore, it is clear that the inscriptions of the later Gaôgas were dated in the Œaka era (583 BCE) and not in the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). Two grants of NarasiÚha IV dated in Œaka 1305 and Œaka 1316 were issued from VÀrÀõasÁ-kaÇaka making it evident that VÀrÀõasÁ was under the control of NarasiÚha IV. If, as the dating suggests, NarasiÚha IV was reigning around 1383-1394 CE, we must remember that the Tughlaq dynasty was ruling over the Delhi Sultanate at that time and VÀrÀõasi had always been under the control of Muslim rulers since the beginning of the 13th century CE. Again, according to the grant of Raghudeva dated in Œaka 1376, the Gajapati king Kapileœvara conquered Dhilli; this event might have occurred during the reign of the Sayyids or Lodhis but there is no such information available from Muslim chronicles. It is also claimed in the inscriptions that the Gajapati kings were the lords of nine crore KarõÀta and Gulburga. This is also quite impossible because a powerful Bahmani Sultanate was already in place in Northern Karnataka and Telangana. According to the Gonugunta rock inscription,90 the Vijayanagara king KrishnadevarÀya subdued Udayagiri in 1510 CE but the Gajapati king PratÀparudra claimed his victorious reign in the year 1432 (1510 CE?) and donated Velicherla village located in the eastern side of Udayagiri. Therefore, the above inconsistencies clearly establish that the later Gaôga king NarasiÚha IV and the early Gajapatis flourished in the 8th and 9th centuries CE and their inscriptions were dated in the Œaka era (583 BCE) and not in the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). The ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) and the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) Two major eras i.e. the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the Œaka era (583 BCE) were widely in vogue in India by the 1st century\n311 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS CE. The KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era was popular in North India whereas the Œaka era was popular in South India. The KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era commenced from the epoch of the coronation of VikramÀditya in 719- 718 BCE and the Œaka era commenced from the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king in 583 BCE. Evidently, the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era followed the KÀrttikÀdi calendar whereas the Œaka era followed the ChaitrÀdi calendar. Though Indian astronomers adopted the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE), it appears that they were not entirely comfortable using this epoch for various astronomical calculations. Evidently, Indian astronomers not only wanted to do away with the epoch that started in commemoration of the coronation of a tyrant MleccÍa king but also felt the necessity to fix a new epoch because the epoch of the Œaka era was not comfortably placed with reference to the epoch of the Kaliyuga era. Thus, Indian astronomers discovered the perfect epoch in the year 78 CE when 3179 years elapsed from the Kaliyuga era. All astronomical treatises written after 78 CE have adopted this epoch for formulating various methods for accurate astronomical calculations. Indian astronomers referred to this epoch as “ŒakanÃpasyÀnte” meaning from the end of Œaka king or from the death of Œaka king. Though the epoch of 78 CE was introduced by the end of the 1st century CE, it was known only to learned astronomers. The common people and royal administrations used only the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE). Interestingly, the famous Indian astronomer Bhaskaracharya used the epoch of “ŒakanÃpasyÀnte” in his treatise SiddhÀnta Œiromaõi for astronomical calculations but refers to the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE) while mentioning the year of his birth. He states that he was born in the year 1036 from the epoch of Œaka king (Rasa(6)-Guõa(3)-PÂrõa(0)-MahÁ(1) sama-Œaka-nÃpa-samaye’bhavan- mamotpattiÍ|). Therefore, the date of birth of Bhaskaracharya must be fixed in the year 452-453 CE and not in 1114 CE. Since the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era followed the KÀrttikÀdi calendar, a necessity was also felt to introduce the ChaitrÀdi calendar in this era during the 2nd century CE. It is well known that there is a gap of 135 years between the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era and the Œaka era. During the process of introducing the ChaitrÀdi calendar, Indian\n312 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA astronomers probably reset the epoch of the Vikrama era in 57 BCE with reference to the epoch of 78 CE ensuring a similar gap of 135 years. Thus, the epochs of 78 CE and 57 BCE were actually introduced by Indian astronomers. The Pimpalner grant of Chalukya SatyÀœrayadeva91 is the earliest inscription which is dated with reference to the epoch of 78 CE. The epoch is referred to as “Œaka-nÃpa-kÀlÀtÁta-saÚvatsara” meaning the years from the end of the era of Œaka king. The Pimpalner grant is dated in the year 310 (388 CE). Thus, the date of Chalukya SatyÀœrayadeva must be fixed in 388 CE. Unfortunately, eminent historians rejected this grant as a forgery because they could not differentiate between the epoch of the coronation of Œaka king and the epoch of the end of Œaka king. The Ahar inscription92 of the time of the PratÁhÀra king Bhojadeva is the earliest inscription which is dated with reference to the epoch of 57 BCE. One document of the Ahar inscription is dated in the year 258 (201 CE). The Peheva inscription93 of Bhojadeva is also dated in the year 276 (219 CE). Though the epochs of 78 CE and 57 BCE were introduced by the 1st or 2nd century CE, these epochs came into popular use only from the 8th century onwards. The use of these epochs became so popular that Indians almost completely forgot the epoch of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the Œaka era (583 BCE) by the 10th century. Interestingly, people started using the same expressions as “ŒÀke”, “ŒÀkÀbde”, “ŒakavarÈa”, etc. for the epoch of 78 CE which created confusion among the astronomers. To differentiate the epoch of 78 CE from the epoch of 583 BCE, Indian astronomers linked the name of ŒÀlivÀhana, the famous king of PratiÈÇhÀna in 9th century CE94 but the use of the name of ŒÀlivÀhana became popular only from the 12thcentury onwards. Similarly, the epoch of 57 BCE was also linked to Harsha VikramÀditya, the renowned king of Avanti who killed the Œaka king and the era was generally referred to as “Œri-nÃpa-Vikrama-saÚvat”. Thus, the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) and the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) were actually introduced by Indian astronomers to improve the methods for accurate astronomical calculations. Later, people assumed that King VikramÀditya founded an era in 57 BCE and ŒÀlivÀhana introduced his era in 78 BCE. Though, the epoch of Vikrama era was\n313 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS reset in 57 BCE to introduce ChaitrÀdi calendar, the use of the KÀrttikÀdi calendar continued along with the ChaitrÀdi calendar. In due course of time, Indians completely forgot the epochs of the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and the Œaka era (583 BCE) and started using only the epochs of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 BCE) and the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) by the 11th century CE. The Valabhi era (319 CE) This era was in use in Kathiawad and the neighbourhood of Gujarat and commenced in 319 CE. Alberuni mentions that the epoch of the Valabhi era falls 241 years after the epoch of the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). He also elaborated the method of calculating this era as used by Indians. According to him, first put down the year of ŒÀlivÀhana era and then subtract from it the cube of 6 and the square of 5 (216 + 25 = 241) and the remainder is the year of the Valabhi era.95Alberuni also states that “people say that the Guptas were very powerful people and that when they ceased to exist, this date (319 CE) was used as the epoch of an era (Valabhi era)”. Western historians and their followers distorted the statement of Alberuni and concocted the fiction that the Valabhi and Gupta eras commenced from the same epoch i.e. 319 CE. In reality, the Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE whereas the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE. The Gupta era has been discussed elaborately in",

The Devli grant96 of PrabhÂtavarÈa GovindarÀja is the earliest inscription dated in the year 500 (819 CE) of the Valabhi era and the Veraval inscription97 of the time of Arjunadeva is the last inscription dated in the year 945 (1264 CE) of the Valabhi era. The calendar of the Valabhi era was KÀrttikÀdi. Though, the epoch of the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE, it appears that the Valabhi era came into use only from the 8th century onwards. The Lakœmaõasena SaÚvat (443-444 CE) Lakœmaõasena was the most illustrious king of the Sena dynasty, the dynasty which ruled Bengal and Bihar during the 5th century CE. The Edilpur grant of the time of BallÀlasena is probably dated in the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era 1136? (417 CE?) as claimed by some sources.98\n314 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA BallÀlasena was the father of Lakœmaõasena and evidently, Lakœmaõasena must have ascended the throne after 417 CE. Interestingly, the Bisapi grant of ŒivasiÚhadeva99 is dated in the year 293 of Lakœmaõasena era, in the year 1455 elapsed of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) and in the year 1321 current of Œaka era (583 BCE). This grant was issued in favour of the poet VidyÀpati Œarma on the 7th tithi of the bright fortnight of ŒrÀvaõa month i.e. 9th July 737 CE. Thus, the epoch of the Lakœmaõasena era commenced on 10th October 443 CE considering 293 years before 737 CE and the calendar was KÀrttikÀdi. Eminent Historians simply dubbed the Bisapi grant spurious because it ran contrary to their distorted chronology. It is well known that the Sena dynasty succeeded the PÀla dynasty. Let us discuss the chronology of the PÀla and Sena dynasties to arrive at the exact epoch of the Lakœmaõasena era. When the rule of the imperial Guptas ended in the beginning of the 1st century BCE, a King named ŒaœÀôka was ruling in Bengal around 35 BCE. According to the Gauçavaho of VÀkpati, Yaœovarman of Kanauj (30-91 CE) killed a Gauça king in battle resulting in a state of anarchy in the Gauda region; taking advantage of the political turmoil in Gauça, GopÀla founded the rule of the PÀla dynasty around 80 CE. The Khalimpur inscription100 tells us that GopÀla, a patron of Buddhism and founder of the Odantapuri MahÀvihÀra, was selected by the people to put an end to anarchy. GopÀla was succeeded by his son DharmapÀla, the most illustrious king of the PÀla dynasty. Soççhala, the author of “UdayasundarÁkathÀ”, refers to DharmapÀla as “UttarÀpathasvÀmi” meaning the lord of north India. The Khalimpur inscription, dated in his 32nd regnal year clearly mentions that DharmapÀla was the master of Kanauj and his authority was accepted by the kings of PÀðchÀla, Bhoja, Matsya, Kuru, Yadu, Yavana, Avanti, GÀndhÀra and the Kira kings (Bhojair-MatsyaiÍ sa- MadraiÍ Kuru-Yadu-YavanÀvanti-GÀndhÀra-KÁraiÍ, BhÂpair-vyÀlola-mauli- praõati-pariõataiÍ......). The king of Avanti was the PratÁhÀra king VatsarÀja who may have also accepted the authority of DharmapÀla for a short period. According to the Bhagalpur inscription101 of NÀrÀyaõapÀla, DharmapÀla dethroned IndrÀyudha and coronated his younger brother ChakrÀyudha on the throne of Kanauj (JitvendrarÀja-\n315 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS prabhÃtÁn-arÀtÁnupÀrjita yena mahodayaœrÁÍ, dattÀ punaÍ sÀ balinÀrthayitre ChakrÀyudhÀyÀnativÀmanÀya |). Jinasena’s HarivaÚœa tells us that IndrÀyudha ruled in Œaka 705 (122 CE). Evidently, DharmapÀla defeated IndrÀyudha after 122 CE. His wife Rannadevi was the daughter of the RÀÈÇrakÂÇa king Parabala. DharmapÀla, who ruled for at least 32 years, founded the VikramaœilÀ and Sonapura MahÀvihÀras. Eminent historians dated the rule of DharmapÀla around 770-812 CE. DharmapÀla himself claimed that the king of GÀndhÀra also accepted his supremacy. GÀndhÀra or Kandahar was under political turmoil due to regular invasions by Arab Muslims during the 8th century CE. There is no evidence to prove that DharmapÀla could expand his influence up to Kandahar at the end of the 8th century. Therefore, historians concocted the myth that GÀndhÀra meant Western Punjab. Actually, DharmapÀla flourished around 110-160 CE and subjugated the king of GÀndhÀra. It is nothing less than a fraud to identify Western Punjab as GÀndhÀra. The Bhagalpur inscription tells us that DharmapÀla’s brother VÀkpÀla played a crucial role in establishing the powerful PÀla kingdom and VÀkpÀla’s son JayapÀla also conquered certain regions. DevapÀla, the son of DharmapÀla, succeeded him. He conquered PrÀgjyotiÈa (Assam) and Utkala (Orissa) but the rise of the PratÁhÀras, followed by the Chedis and the ParamÀras in the north gradually weakened the PÀla kingdom. Probably, the poet Abhinanda, the author of RÀmacharita was in the court of YuvarÀja HÀravarÈa (DevapÀla or his brother) who was the son of VikramaœÁla i.e. DharmapÀla.VigrahapÀla was the son of DevapÀla. He married the daughter of a king of the Haihaya (Chedi) dynasty (quite likely Kokalladeva, the founder of the Chedi dynasty). NÀrÀyaõapÀla, the son of VigrahapÀla, succeeded him. According to the Bangarh grant,102 NÀrÀyaõapÀla’s son was RÀjyapÀla, RajyapÀla’s son was GopÀla II, GopÀla II’s son was VigrahapÀla II and VigrahapÀla II’s son was MahipÀla I. NayapÀla succeeded MahipÀla I. VigrahapÀla III was the son of NayapÀla. According to SandhyÀkar Nandi’s RÀmacaritam, VigrahapÀla III married YauvanaœrÁ, the daughter of the Chedi king Karõa (389-419 CE). The Manahali grant103 informs us that VigrahapÀla III had three sons named MahÁpÀla II, ŒÂrapÀla and RÀmapÀla. The poet SandhyÀkar Nandi composed his work RÀmacaritam during the reign of\n316 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA MadanapÀla, the son of RÀmapÀla. SandhyÀkar Nandi’s father PrajÀpati was the SÀndhi-vigrahika (the minister of peace and war) of the PÀla king RÀmapÀla. Jagaddala, a Buddhist education centre was founded by RÀmapÀla. He also founded a city named RÀmavati. RÀmapÀla also had three sons named KumÀrapÀla, GopÀla III and MadanapÀla. SandhyÀkar Nandi mentions the names of two more sons, VittapÀla and RÀjyapÀla. An inscription of MadanapÀla is dated in KV 1201 (482 CE)104 and his Valgudar inscription105 is dated in Œaka 1083 (500 CE) [Œaka-nÃpateÍ 1083] and in the 18th regnal year. SandhyÀkar Nandi states that MadanapÀla had to preserve the prestige of the PÀla Empire by a close alliance with Chandra. Most probably, Chandra was the GÀhadwÀla king Govindachandra. MadanapÀla’s successor, GovindapÀla ruled for at least 39 years because some manuscripts of Nepal are dated in his 37th, 38th and 39th regnal year (Srimad-GovindapÀlapÀdÀnÀm SaÚ 39 bhÀdradine 14).106 The chronology of the PÀla dynasty: In CE GopÀla I 80-110 CE DharmapÀla 110-160 CE DevapÀla 161-212 CE VigrahapÀla I 212-220 CE NÀrÀyaõapÀla 220-274 CE RÀjyapÀla 274-298 CE GopÀla II 298-300 CE VigrahapÀla II 300-310 CE MahÁpÀla I 310-360 CE NayapÀla 360-400CE VigrahapÀla III 400-420 CE MahÁpÀla II 420-436 CE ŒÂrapÀla — RÀmapÀla 436-478 CE KumÀrapÀla 478-481 CE GopÀla III 481-482 CE\n317 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS MadanapÀla 482-500 CE GovindapÀla 500-540 CE An Arab merchant called Suleiman visited Bengal in 951 CE and refers to the kings of Bengal as Ruhmi or Rahma in his book “Silsiltut- Tauarikh”. Historians distorted the statements of Suleiman and concocted the story that Ruhmi or Rahma meant the PÀla kingdom. Actually, the PÀla kings flourished from around the 1st century CE till the 6th century CE. Therefore, Suleiman, who visited Bengal in the 10th century CE, refers to the ruling kingdom of that time as Ruhmi or Rahma not as PÀlas. SÀmantasena, the earliest known king of the Sena dynasty, was likely a feudatory of the PÀla kings. His son Hemantasena and grandson Vijayasena laid the foundations for the sovereign kingdom of the Sena dynasty. It was BallÀlasena, the son of Vijayasena, who conquered Gauça from the PÀlas and made NavadvÁpa his capital. In general, the Sena kings ruled over the MithilÀ region or the Bihar-Bengal region. The Edilpur grant107 tells us that BallÀlasena defeated his enemies and that his son, Lakœmaõasena erected pillars of victory at VÀrÀõasÁ, PrayÀga and PurÁ. Probably, BallÀlasena ascended the throne around 400 CE. YuvarÀja Lakœmaõasena successfully led the army and established a strong kingdom. According to the Samaya PrakÀœa, BallÀlasena authored the treatise titled DÀnasÀgara in Œaka 1011 (428 CE) and lived for three years more, thereby indicating that he died in 431 CE.108 Though Lakœmaõasena came to the throne in 431 CE, controlled the administration even during the lifetime of his father. Interestingly, HalÀyudha, the author of BrÀhmaõa Sarvasva, tells us that Lakœmaõasena made him the court Pandit when he was a boy, that when he became a youth he was made prime minister and that when he ceased to be a youth he was made DharmÀdhikÀrÁ (Chief Justice).109 Lakœmaõasena founded a city named LakœmaõavatÁ (known as Lakhnauti) in Malda district of West Bengal on the India-Bangladesh border. A slab found inscribed in the doorway of the Lakœmaõasena Palace tells us that there were five gems in the court of Lakœmaõasena named Govardhana, Œaraõa, Jayadeva, UmÀpati and KavirÀja.\n318 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “Govardhanaœca Œaraõo Jayadeva UmÀpatiÍ | KavirÀjaœca ratnÀni samitau Lakœmaõasya ca|| ”110 The famous poem “GÁta-Govindam” was composed by Jayadeva during the reign of Lakœmaõasena. Some scholars identified KavirÀja with the poet Dhoyi who wrote “PavanadÂtam”that was inspired by KÀlidÀsa’s MeghadÂtam. KavirÀja was the author of “RÀghava- PÀndavÁyam”. SandhyÀkar Nandi mentions that there were only three poets who were experts in writing of Vakrokti (vakrokti-mÀrga-nipuõÀÍ), namely Subandhu, BÀõabhaÇÇa and KavirÀja. Lakœmaõasena himself was a great author who completed the treatise “AdbhutasÀgara” started by his father BallÀlasena. Probably, Lakœmaõasena died in 443 CE. ViœvarÂpasena was the son of Lakœmaõasena and his MadanapÀda grant111 is dated in his 14th regnal year. The Edilpur grant was issued by Keœavasena, the second son of Lakœmaõasena. ViœvarÂpasena had two sons, named SÂryasena and PuruÈottamasena. Lakœmaõasena was the most illustrious and the most popular king of the Sena dynasty and the Lakœmaõasena era (LS) was undoubtedly founded to pay homage to him. The reference to “Lakœmaõasenasya atÁtarÀjye” in the inscriptions clearly indicates that the era has the epoch of the end of the reign of Lakœmaõasena. Two inscriptions of the time of king Aœokachalla are dated in LS 51 (494 CE) and LS 74 (517 CE).112 The Janibigha grant of king Jayasena is dated in LS 83 (526 CE).113 Interestingly, the Janibigha grant was issued to Vajrasena for the residence of a Simhalese monk MaugalasvÀmi. The Khojpur Durga image inscription of Suryakara is dated in LS 147 (590 CE).114 The Bisapi grant dated in LS 293 (737 CE)115 clearly informs us that the Lakœmaõasena era commenced in 443 CE. The author of Samaya PrakÀœa states that BallÀlasena wrote the book “DÀnasÀgara” in Œaka 1011 (428 CE) and as he lived for three years more, it proves Lakœmaõasena ruled around 431-443 CE. According to Nagendranath Vasu, DÀnasÀgara was written in Œaka 1091 (œaœi-nava-daœa-miteŒaka-varÈe DÀnasÀgaro rachitaÍ).116 The text of DÀnasÀgara may have been edited from “Œaœi- dvaya-daœa-mite” (Œaka 1011) to “Œaœi-nava-daœa-mite” (Œaka 1091). In the beginning of AdbutasÀgara, it is mentioned that BallÀlasena started writing it in Œaka 1089 (506 CE) [ŒÀke navÀÈÇakhendvÀkhyeÀrebhe’dbhutasÀgaram].117\n319 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS We need to verify this from the original manuscripts. Moreover, the dates of the Bisapi grant and Samaya PrakÀœa cannot be explained if the date of DÀnasÀgara is accepted as Œaka 1091 (508 CE) and the date of AdbhutasÀgara as Œaka 1089 (506 CE). There is also inconsistency in these dates because BallÀlasena started writing AdbhutasÀgara after completing the DÀnasÀgara. Considering the dates of the Bisapi grant and Samaya PrakÀœa, BallÀlasena ought to have started writing AdbhutasÀgara in Œaka 1013 (430 CE) or 1014 (431 CE). The chronology of the Sena dynasty: In CE SÀmantasena 300-330 CE Hemantasena 330-350 CE Vijayasena (ArirÀja-VÃÈabha-Œankara) 350-410 CE BallÀlasena (ArirÀja-Niœœaôka-Œankara) 404-431 CE Lakœmaõasena (ArirÀja-Madana-Œankara) 431-443 CE Keœavasena — ViœvarÂpasena (ArirÀja-VÃÈbhÀôka-Œankara) 444-460 CE The rule of the Sena dynasty ended due to the rise of the GÀhadwÀlas in Kanauj and the re-emergence of the PÀlas under the leadership of RÀmapÀla. The Bisapi grant tells us that King Œivasimhadeva ruled in Bengal in KV 1455 elapsed (737 CE). VidyÀpati wrote PuruÈa-ParÁkœÀ during the reign of ŒivasiÚhadeva. He also wrote DurgÀbhakti-TaraôgiõÁ during the reign of NarasiÚhadeva, the son of Œivasimhadeva. VidyÀpati refers to Œivasimhadeva and his son DhÁrasiÚha as Paðca-Gauçeœvara i.e. lords of five regions of Gauça (ŒauryÀvarjita-Paðca-Gauça-dharaõÁ- nÀthopanamrÁkÃtÀn). Interestingly, VidyÀpati copied the BhÀgavata- PurÀõa in the year of Lakœmaõasena era 349 (792 CE) with his own hand and this copy was in possession of his descendants around 1885 CE. It is evident from the Bisapi grant and the works of the poet VidyÀpati Œarma that the family of ŒivasiÚhadeva ruled MithilÀ and Gauda in the 8th century CE. The rise of the Gajapati dynasty at the end of the 8th century CE ended the rule of the family of Œivasimhadeva.\n320 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The genealogy of Œivasimhadeva: In CE Bhavasimhadeva 690-710 CE DevasiÚha 710-730 CE Œivasimhadeva 720-750 CE NarasiÚhadeva 750-775 CE DhÁrasiÚhadeva 775-795 CE BhairavasiÚhadeva — Western historians rejected the Bisapi grant and relied instead on the edited date of the DÀnasÀgara (Œaka 1091) and the historical account given by Muslim historians. Minhajuddin, the Muslim historian and the author of Tabaqat-e-Nasiri, records that Bakhtiar Khilji conquered Bengal in 1203 CE and at that time a king named “Lakhmaniya” was on the throne of Navadvipa and he was eighty years old.118According to the Ain-e-Akbari; “When the cup of life of RÀja Naujah overflowed, the sovereignty fell to Lakhmaniya, the son of Rai Lakhman. Nadia was at that time the capital of Bengal and the seat of various learning. ........ Bahktiar Khilji took possession of Bihar by force of arms, and when he marched upon Bengal, the RÀja escaped in a boat. Muhammad Bakhtiyar entered Bengal and having amassed enormous plunder, he destroyed the city of Nadia and transferred the capital to Lakhnauti.”119 Eminent historians identified the so-called “Lakhmaniya” as Lakœmaõasena, distorted the entire chronology of the Sena dynasty and arbitrarily fixed the date of Lakœmaõasena around 1179-1203 CE. As discussed above, the Sena kings flourished in the 5th century CE and not in the 12th century CE. The list of seven kings given by Abul Fazal belongs to the later kings of Bengal. According to the Ain-e-Akbari, the following seven kings ruled for 106 years:120 Duration in years In CE Sukh Sen 1095-1097 CE Balal Sen 1097-1147 CE Lakhan Sen 1147-1154 CE\n321 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS Madhu Sen 1154-1164 CE Kesu Sen 1164-1179 CE Sada Sen 1179-1197 CE Raja Naujah 1197-1200 CE Evidently, Abul Fazal stated that the ruling dynasty ended with the death of Raja Naujah and Lakhmaniya, the son of Lakhman, who ruled around 1200-1203 CE. Lakhmaniya apparently was not from the ruling family and was eighty years old when Bakhtiar Khilji invaded Nadia. Moreover, the genealogy of the Sena kings is completely different from the list of kings given by Abul Fazal. As discussed above, the Sena dynasty ruled MithilÀ and Gauça in the 5th century and not in the 12th century. If the Sena kings had indeed ruled in the 12th century, how could ViœvarÂpasena, the son of Lakœmaõasena, proclaim himself as MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja and Gauçeœvara when Bakhtiar Khilji, followed by Ali Merdan and Ghiyasuddin had established their supremacy in Bengal and Bihar? How could VidyÀpati refer to Œivasimhadeva and his son DhÁrasiÚha as Paðca-Gauçeœvara in the 15thcentury CE? The Madanapada grant refers to ViœvarÂpasena as “Garga- YavanÀnvaya-pralaya-kÀla-rudra” meaning the terrible destroyer of the Garga and Yavana dynasties. It is well known that the KÀÚboja kings were ruling in Gauça. Evidently, ViœvarÂpasena might have defeated the Yavanas i.e. KÀÚbojas. Historians identified Yavanas as Muslims. There is no evidence to prove that a Gauça king defeated Musilm invaders around 1210-1230 CE. Eminent historians have not been able to explain the exact epoch of the Lakœmaõasena era till date. Kielhorn opined that the epoch commenced in 1118-19 CE and that 1119-20 CE was the first year, but his conclusion is completely based on a vague equation “Laksh : Sam: 505 = Œaka Sam: 1546”from a manuscript of the SmÃtitattvÀmrita. The reckoning of the Lakœmaõasena era was calculated differently in different places in later times but the earliest reference is found in the Bisapi Grant that clearly tells us that the epoch commenced in 443-444 CE considering the epoch of KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 CE) and the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king (583 BCE).\n322 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The Bisapi grant is the strongest epigraphic evidence for calculating the epoch of the Lakœmaõasena era. None of the grants of the Sena kings used this era which indicates that the reckoning of the Lakœmaõasena era apparently commenced after the end of the reign of Lakœmaõasena and also that of ViœvarÂpasena. The reference “Lakœmaõasenasya atÁtarÀjye” also clearly informs us that the epoch undoubtedly commenced from the end of the reign of Lakœmaõasena. Historians ridiculously fixed the epoch as the birth of Lakœmaõasena. The SiÚha SaÚvat (450-451 CE) The Chaulukya king JayasiÚha SiddharÀja (433-480 CE) founded this era in 450-451 CE and the calendar was probably KÀrttikÀdi. Thus, the epoch of SiÚha SaÚvat commenced on 22ndSeptember 450 CE. The Mangrol inscription121 of the time of the Chaulukya king KumÀrapÀla is dated on the 13th tithi of the dark fortnight of °œvina month in KV 1202 and SiÚha era 32 i.e. 15th Oct 483 CE. A grant of BhÁmadeva II122 is dated on the 11th tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month in SiÚha era 93 and on the occasion of MeÈa saÚkrÀnti i.e. 21st Mar 544 CE. Another grant of BhÁmadeva II123 is dated on the 14th tithi of the bright fortnight of MÀrgaœÁrÈa month in KV 1266 and SiÚha era 96 i.e. 22nd Nov 546 CE. It is, therefore, evident that the reckoning of the SiÚha era started from 450-451 CE. Two later inscriptions also refer to SiÚha SaÚvat which indicates that another SiÚha era was founded in 1109 CE or 1113 CE. The Junagarh inscription is dated in the year 850 of the Valabhi era and in the year 60 of the SiÚha era.124 TheVeraval inscription is dated in the year 1320 of the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era, in the year 945 of the Valabhi era and in the year 151 of the SiÚha era.125 Evidently, the Junagarh inscription indicates the epoch of 1109 CE whereas the Veraval inscription considered the epoch of 1113 CE.

    "content": ", the inscriptions of the Chaulukya kings used only the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE). The Valabhi era came into use much later. Therefore, the Junagarh and Veraval inscriptions belong to later kings of Anhilwad and the SiÚha SaÚvat used in these inscriptions is different from the SiÚha SaÚvat used in the Mangrol inscription and the two grant of BhÁmadeva II.\n323 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS The old SiÚha era was founded in 450-451 CE by the Chaulukya king JayasiÚha SiddharÀja whereas another Simha era commenced in 1109 CE or 1113 CE. Probably, the SiÚha era referred to in the Junagarh and Veraval inscriptions is the Œiva-SiÚha era which was established by the Gohils in the island of Div as opined by Col James Tod.126 The Chalukya Vikrama SaÚvat Bilhaõa, a Kashmiri Sanskrit poet, was in the court of the Chalukya VikramÀditya of KalyÀõa in Karnataka. He wrote a MahÀkÀvya named “VikramÀôkadevacaritam”. He elaborated the life-account of Chalukya Vikrama in 17 cantos. Interestingly, Bilhaõa chronicles his autobiography in the 18th canto: he was born in the village Khonmusha in Kashmir which is today called Khonmuh. This village is situated four kilometres from Jaivan (Jayavana). Bilhaõa also mentions the city of Pravarapura which is situated near modern Srinagar. He tells us that a king of Kashmir named GopÀditya had brought his ancestors to Kashmir from Central India. Bilhaõa mentions the Kashmir kings Anantadeva, Kalaœa and Harshadeva. We learn from Kalhaõa’s RÀjataraôgiõÁ that Bilhaõa left Kashmir during the reign of King Kalaœa and reached Karnataka. King Vikrama (ParmÀçi) appointed him as VidyÀpati in his court. According to Bilhaõa, he left Kashmir and first went to Mathura and Vrindavan, and then travelled to KÀnyakubja (Kanauj) and VÀrÀõasÁ where he met the Chedi king Karõa (389-419 CE). Interestingly, Bilhaõa defeated GaôgÀdhara, a famous scholar in a debate (ŒÀstrÀrtha) at the court of the Chedi king Karõa. Thereafter, he reached the city of DhÀrÀ in MÀlava. When he reached DhÀrÀ, he was shocked to hear of the death of the great king Bhoja. Bilhaõa expressed his pain in a poetic way, that the pigeons living in the holes of the gate of DhÀrÀ city questioned him; “Oh Bilhaõa, why did you not come to DhÀrÀ while RÀjÀ Bhoja was alive? “BhojaÍ kshmÀbhÃtsa khalu na khalaistasya sÀmyam narendraiÍ, tatpratyakœam kimiti bhavatÀnÀgatam hÀ hatÀsmi | yasya dvÀroççamaraœikharakroda-pÀrÀvatÀnÀm, nÀdavyÀjÀditi sakaruõam vyÀjahÀreva DhÀrÀ || ”127\n324 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Bilhaõa immediately left DhÀrÀ and reached SomanÀth in Gujarat but not being too happy with the people of Gujarat and driven by the ambition to be patronised by a magnificent king such as Bhoja, he directed his steps towards the south (SÀmÀnyorvÁpatiÈu vimukhaÍœekharo’sau budhÀnÀm, yÀtastasyÀm kakubhi œanakaih kautuki dakœiõasyÀm |)128 and reached the court of Chalukya VikramÀditya also known as Tribhuvanamalla, where he was appointed as VidyÀpati. It is evident that when Bilhaõa reached the city of DhÀrÀ, he came to know about the sad demise of King Bhoja. Based on the epigraphic evidence, king Bhoja died by KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama 1112 elapsed (394 CE). The Mandhata grant129 was issued in the year KV 1112 elapsed (393-394 BCE) by JayasiÚha, the son of Bhoja. The Chedi king Karõa ascended the throne in 389 CE because his VÀrÀõasÁ grant130 was issued in the Kalachuri-Chedi year 793 (390 CE) on the occasion of the first death anniversary of his father GÀôgeyadeva. Thus, Bilhaõa, who probably wrote VikramÀôkadevacaritam by 400 CE, started his journey from Kashmir in the beginning of the year 389 CE and finally reached the kingdom of Chalukya VikramÀditya by the end of 394 CE.

Many inscriptions of both the Tribhuvanamallas are dated in an era referred to as “Chalukya Vikrama varÈa”. Historians considered both the Tribhuvanamallas as one person and named the era Chalukya Vikrama SaÚvat. They concluded that the epoch of Chalukya Vikrama era commenced in 1076 CE. More than 100\n325 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS inscriptions of the Chalukyas refer to Chalukya Vikrama SaÚvat starting from the year 2 to the year 80 out of which 17 inscriptions record verifiable details of solar eclipses. As shown in Appendix VI, only five eclipses out of 17 can be verified with reference to the epoch of 1076 CE. There is something seriously wrong in the epoch of the Chalukya Vikrama era considered by modern historians. In my opinion, we have to segregate the inscriptions of Tribhuvanamalla into two groups. One group of inscriptions may belong to the Tribhuvanamalla who was a contemporary of the ParamÀra king Bhoja and another group of inscriptions may belong to the Tribhuvanamalla who became king in 1076 CE. The ancient era of Nepal or LiccÍavi era (966 BCE) The CÍÀngÂ pillar inscription of the LiccÍavi king MÀnadeva131 is dated in the year 386 of an ancient era of Nepal. Interestingly, the later successors of MÀnadeva used the Sri Harsha era (457 BCE) in their inscriptions. As discussed in detail in",

    "content": ", the epoch of the era used in the inscriptions of MÀnadeva may have commenced around 966 BCE. It would be appropriate to name this ancient era as “LiccÍavi era”. Evidently, an ancient system of intercalation i.e. Pauœha-°ÈÀçha intercalation was followed by the LiccÍavi kings which was based on VedÀôga JyotiÈa. It may be noted that MÀnadeva flourished before the Sri Harsha who founded an era in 457 BCE. Historians simply assumed, without any evidence whatsoever, that MÀnadeva used the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE). The MÀnadeva SaÚvat (85-84 BCE) Sumatitantra (probably authored by a South Indian named Sumati), a popular treatise on astronomy in Nepal, is dated in the year 304 of MÀnadevÀbda i.e. the era of MÀnadeva (304 Œri-MÀnadevÀbda....).132 The manuscript of Sahottaratantra is also dated in the year 301 of MÀnadeva era (RÀjði Œri-MÀnadeve ..... varÈe caikottare’smin tritaya-œatagate).133 The Lokeœvara pedestal inscription of Patan is also dated in the year 180 of MÀnadeva era (RÀjyeŒri-MÀnadevasya varÈe’œÁtyuttareœate).134 Some\n326 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA manuscripts of HarivaÚœa and JÀtakajyÀ also mention a MÀnadeva SaÚvat confirming that a MÀnadeva era was in vogue in ancient Nepal. Some scholars propounded that the MÀnadeva SaÚvat started during the reign of King MÀnadeva II who founded it in ŒÀlivÀhana 498 (576 CE). According to some VaÚœÀvalis, MÀnadeva II ruled for 53 or 25 years between Udayadeva and Gaõadeva. There is a controversy about the existence of MÀnadeva II and quite possibly, the reference to MÀnadeva II may be the result of scribal error which has been handed down to all the 19th century VaÚœÀvalis. Some historians even declared that the inclusion of the name of MÀnadeva II is an historical fraud. Kamal P. Malla, a proud member of the Royal Society, London, made an investigation into this so-called historical fraud.135 The main problem is that some historians assumed that the inscriptions of the LiccÍavi kings are dated in ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE).

    "content": ", the inscriptions of MÀnadeva I are dated in an ancient era of Nepal and the earliest inscription of MÀnadeva I is dated in the year 386 (580 BCE). Thus, it may be noted that the earliest inscriptions of Nepal used an ancient era (966 BCE) which was replaced by the Sri Harsha era (457 BCE) during the reign of Œivadeva and his feudatory Aôœuvarman I. Undoubtedly, the LiccÍavi feudatory Aôœuvarman I and the successors of the LiccÍavi king Œivadeva used the Sri Harsha era in their inscriptions. Most probably, Sri Harsha conquered Nepal around 430-429 BCE and introduced his era in Nepal. Therefore, the inscriptions of Aôœuvarman I are dated from the year 29 of Sri Harsha era onwards. Some historians ridiculously argued that Aôœuvarman I just dropped the figure of hundreds since the year 529 and used only 29. A recently found Gokarõa inscription of Aôœuvarman I dated in 536 (430 BCE)136 provides firm evidence that Aôœuvarman I did not drop the figure of hundreds starting from the year 529. The Gokarõa inscription was written in the intercalary PauÈa month which also confirms that Aôœuvarman I used the epoch of the ancient era that commenced around 966 BCE. Since Sri Harsha subjugated the LiccÍavis around 430 BCE and introduced his era (457 BCE) in Nepal, Aôœuvarman I started using Sri Harsha era from the year 29 (429-428 BCE).\n327 AN OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ERAS Undoubtedly, MÀnadeva SaÚvat came into use in Nepal much later. According to Sumatitantra, MÀnadeva era commenced when the 498th year of the Œaka era elapsed.

Actually, “ŒatÀÈÇam” is a SamÀhÀra Dvandva compound and derived as œatam ca aÈÇa ca = ŒatÀÈÇam. In case it is a SaôkhyÀ tatpuruÈa compound and derived as ŒatÀnÀm aÈÇa, then the compound word should be “aÈÇaœatam”. Thus, “ŒatÀÈÇam”means 108 and it cannot be interpreted as 800. It is totally absurd to accept the reign of the Nandas for 800 years. The author of Sumatitantra states in the above verses that the Nanda dynasty ascended the throne after the completion of 2000 years from the eve of Kaliyuga when Duryodhana and YudhiÈÇhira were ruling. The Nandas ruled for 108 years; thereafter, Chandragupta and his dynasty ruled for 132 years; King ŒÂdraka and his dynasty followed Chandragupta and ruled for 247 years; thereafter, the Œaka king ascended the throne and 498 years elapsed from the reign of the Œaka king. We need to add 304 years of the MÀnadeva era to arrive at the current year of Kaliyuga i.e. 117 BCE. There is an error of 32 years because the Œaka king was coronated in 583 BCE as conclusively proven in",

    "content": ". Sumatitantra clearly tells us that the MÀnadeva era commenced in Œaka 498 elapsed. Considering the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king (583 BCE), the epoch of MÀnadeva SaÚvat can be placed in 85-84 BCE. Probably, Sumatitantra was written in the year 304 of MÀnadeva\n328 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA SaÚvat i.e. 219 CE and Sahottaratantra was written in the year 301 of MÀnadeva SaÚvat i.e. 216 CE. It appears that the MÀnadeva era was introduced during the reign of Aôœuvarman II, the son-in-law of the last LiccÍavi king Viœvadeva. According to VaÚœÀvali, Aôœuvarman II ascended the throne in the year 3000 (101 BCE) of the Kaliyuga era.138As of now, there is no evidence to prove the reign of King MÀnadeva II around 85 BCE. Possibly, this era was named after MÀnadeva I to immortalise the name of the greatest king of LiccÍavi dynasty. \u0002\n329 The PurÀõas are one of the most significant sources of the history of ancient India from the MahÀbhÀrata war till the Gupta period. Though the currently available PurÀõas were compiled between 500 BCE and 200 CE, they have been updated, re-modelled and re-written many times over. The PurÀõas were chronicles in ancient times but evolved into veritable encyclopaedias by the post Gupta period. Some PurÀõas such as MÀrkaôçeya, VÀyu, Matsya and ViÈõu were updated not later than the 1st century BCE. The Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta was written much later, probably around the 9th or 10th century CE. The Matsya, VÀyu, BrahmÀnça and ViÈõu PurÀõas and the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta provide invaluable information of the history of the various royal dynasties which flourished in ancient India. There has been a systematic attempt to distort Indian chronology by colonial historians and their blind followers in modern times. With the invention of the mischievous and fraudulent theory of the Aryan invasion, western historians led Indian historical research in a wrong direction. They not only sabotaged the Puranic chronology of ancient India but also systematically defamed and demonised the literary evidences of ancient Indian history. Western historians deliberately identified the so-called “Sandrokottus” with Chandragupta Maurya and this major distortion in the chronology of ancient India led to many speculative theories later on.

    "content": "The Puranic Chronology of Ancient India\n330 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Venkatachalam have done extensive research on the Puranic chronology of ancient India. According to Arrian (86-160 CE), “From the time of Dionysos to Sandrokottus, the Indians counted 153 kings and a period of 6042 years.”1 Pliny, the elder (23-79 CE) also states that ”From the time of Father Liber [Dionysos] to Alexandrus, 153 kings of India are counted in a period of 6451 years and three months.”2 Thus, the chronological history of Indian royal dynasties is very ancient and goes back to 6776 BCE (6451+325). Interestingly, recent research based on the astronomical references in the VÀlmiki RÀmÀyaõa, reveals that RÀma was probably born in 5114 BCE.3 We learn from the Vishnu PurÀõa, BhÀgavata PurÀõa and VÀlmÁki RÀmÀyaõa that RÀma was the 64th king in the genealogy of SÂrya VaÚœa. Considering an average reign of 27 years for each king, 63 kings of SÂrya VaÚœa ruled for 1700 years approximately. The statement of Pliny the elder seems to be absolutely accurate and the chronological history of the SÂrya VaÚœa kings started around 6776 BCE. The Chronology of the Surya VaÚœi Kings KÀlidÀsa’s RaghuvaÚœa also gives the genealogy of the SÂrya VaÚœa from King DilÁpa to King Agnivarõa. The ViÈõu PurÀõa mentions the names of kings before DilÁpa and also enumerates eight more kings after Agnivarõa. King IkœvÀku was the founder of the SÂrya VaÚœa and King Brihadbala was the last ruler. Evidently, KÀlidÀsa (105-25 BCE) followed the ViÈõu PurÀõa with a slight difference because it mentions Raghu as the son of DÁrghabÀhu and the grandson of DilÁpa while KÀlidÀsa mentions Raghu as the son of DilÁpa. The chronology of the kings of SÂrya VaÚœa: In CE 1-60 IkœvÀku to DÁrghabÀhu 6776-5177 BCE 61. Raghu 62. Aja 5176-5089 BCE 63. Daœaratha\n331 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 64. RÀma 65.

When he died, his wife was pregnant. She ascended the throne as Queen-regent. It appears that the glorious dynasty of Raghu slipped into a dark period because KÀlidÀsa’s RaghuvaÚœa abruptly ends with Agnivarõa. Probably, the kingdom of AyodhyÀ was revived by later kings. The ViÈõu PurÀõa enumerates eight more kings after Agnivarõa and the last king Brihadbala participated in the MahÀbhÀrata war and died.\n332 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 1. Œighra 2. Maru 3.

MahÀnandin 53 years 1669-1616 BCE The last king of the ŒiœunÀga dynasty, MahÀnandin had an illegitimate son named MahÀpadma Nanda who succeeded him and founded the rule of the Nanda dynasty. MahÀpadma Nanda had eight sons and SumÀlya was the eldest. In general, MahÀpadma Nanda and his eight sons were referred to as the nine Nandas. According to the PurÀõas, Mahapadma Nanda defeated all the kings of his time and established the mighty Magadha Empire. He was the first emperor who ruled almost over the whole of India after the MahÀbhÀrata war. The Nanda dynasty ruled for 100 years. The Matsya PurÀõa tells us that 1500 years elapsed from the birth of King ParÁkœit till the coronation of MahÀpadma Nanda and the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta mentions that the Great Bear (SaptarÈis) was in the Œravaõa constellation during the reign of Nandas. “MahÀpadmÀbhiÈekÀttu yÀvajjanma ParÁkœitaÍ| ekameva sahasraôtu jðeyam paðca-œatottaram |”8 “Œravaõe te bhaviÈyanti kÀle Nandasya bhÂpateÍ|| ”9 Considering the birth of king ParÁkœit in the same year of the MahÀbhÀrata war i.e. 3128 BCE, 1500 years have elapsed as on 1628 BCE. The Great bear was in MaghÀ nakœatra around 3176-3077 BCE and in Œravaõa nakœatra around 1676-1576 BCE. Only Sumatitantra tells us that the Nandas started ruling after 2000 years from the start of the Kaliyuga era (3102 BCE) but the PurÀõas completely differ from such chronology.\n336 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Considering the reign of 63 years, the last king of the ŒiœunÀga dynasty, MahÀnandin died in 1616 BCE. MahÀpadma Nanda ascended the throne in 1616 BCE. Nine kings of the Nanda dynasty ruled for 100 years around 1616-1516 BCE. The legendary scholar Chanakya became the patron of Chandragupta, an illegitimate child of a Nanda king. He led Chandragupta to kill the last Nanda king and placed him on the throne of Magadha around 1516 BCE ending the tyranny of the Nanda dynasty; thus did Chandragupta come to found the rule of the Maurya dynasty. According to one manuscript of the Matsya PurÀõa written in the Tamil grantha script and the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttanta, 12 kings of the Maurya dynasty ruled for 300 years whereas the ViÈõu PurÀõa gives only 137 years. Actually, the Mauryan kingdom weakened after king Aœoka. Probably, the ViÈõu PurÀõa considered Mauryan rule only up to the Aœoka. Thus, the Maurya dynasty ruled for 300 years. As discussed in",

The last Œuôga king DevabhÂti was an incompetent ruler and addicted to unvirtuous ways from his childhood. His minister Vasudeva killed him and became the king of Magadha. Vasudeva was the descendant of the KÀõvÀyana gotra and founded the rule of the Kaõva dynasty. According to the PurÀõas, four kings of the Kaõva dynasty ruled for a period of 85 years. The chronology of the Kaõva dynasty (915-830 BCE):\n338 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Duration of Reign In CE 1. Vasudeva 39 years 915-876 BCE 2. BhÂmimitra 24 years 876-852 BCE 3. NÀrÀyaõa 12 years 852-840 BCE 4. Suœarman 10 years 840-830 BCE The PurÀõas tell us that Simuka or SiÚhaka ascended the throne of Magadha after overthrowing the last Kaõva king Suœarman and founded the ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty. The early ŒÀtavÀhanas were feudatories of the Mauryan Empire as mentioned in a fragment of the 6th pillar edict of Aœoka. The VÀyu PurÀõa clearly states that the Great Bear was in MaghÀ constellation for a hundred years during the reign of king ParÁkœit around 3176-3077 BCE and will again be in the 24th nakœatra constellation from MaghÀ (i.e. ChitrÀ nakœatra) by the time of the start of the °ndhra (ŒÀtavÀhana) dynasty around 876-777 BCE. “SaptarÈayo MaghÀyuktÀÍ kÀle PÀrikœite œatam | °ndhrÀÚœe sacaturviÚœe bhaviÈyanti mate mama|| ”11 Thus, Simuka founded the rule of the ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty around 830 BCE. One inscription at Naneghat mentions the king Simuka ŒÀtavÀhana and an inscription at the Nasik cave refers to the name of the 2nd king KÀnha. Most probably, the inscriptions found in the cave of Naneghat12 belong to the reign of the 5th ŒÀtavÀhana king Œri ŒÀtakarõi and the NÀgÀnikÀ mentioned in the inscriptions was his mother. Probably, Œri ŒÀtakarõi was also known as Vedi Œri ŒÀtakarõi. One coin found in the village BÀlpur in Raipur District, Chattisgarh mentions the name of the 8th king ApÁlaka or ApÁtaka. The name of the 13th king Kuntala ŒÀtakarõi was referred to in VÀtsyÀyana’s KÀmasÂtra and RÀjaœekhara’s KÀvyamÁmÀôsa. The 18th king AriÈÇa ŒÀtakarõi and 19th king HÀla ŒÀtakarõi were contemporaries of the Œaka king RudradÀman. HÀla was the most celebrated ŒÀtavÀhana king in literature. He was the author of GÀthÀsaptaœatÁ. His name is mentioned in LÁlÀvatÁ, AbhidhÀna CintÀmaõÁ, DeœinÀmamÀlÀ, etc. GuõÀçhya, the famous author of Vaçça KathÀ (BÃhatkathÀ), was in the court of king HÀla. Interestingly, DurvinÁta, the king of the Gaôga dynasty, translated the Vaçça KathÀ from the PaiœÀchi dialect to Sanskrit in the 2nd century BCE. The 25th king GautamÁputra ŒÀtakarõi was the last illustrious king of the ŒÀtavÀhana\n339 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA dynasty. He defeated the Œaka kings and annexed their regions to his empire. According to the Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta, there were 32 kings of the ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty and ruled for approximately 500 years. Interestingly, the VÀyu PurÀõa names only 19 kings but tells us that there were 30 kings. The Matsya PurÀõa also states that 19 kings ruled for 460 years but actually enumerates 31 kings and omits the name of the 9th King MeghaswÀti and does not give the number of regnal years of Saumya ŒÀtakarõi. The individual reigns of 30 kings given by the Matsya PurÀõa adds up to a total of 493 years.13 It is likely that the people who were entrusted with the periodical updating of the PurÀõas committed these errors. It is clear that the Matsya PurÀõa and Kaliyuga RÀja VÃttÀnta provide accurate and authentic information about the ŒÀtavÀhana dynasty and it can be concluded that 30 or 32 ŒÀtavÀhana kings ruled approximately for 493 years.

Thus, Chandragupta I took control over the Magadha Empire, killed the minor king PulomÀn III later on and founded the rule of the Gupta dynasty in 338 BCE. Chandragupta I shifted the capital of the Magadha Empire from Girivraja or RajagÃha to PÀtalÁputra and anointed himself as “MahÀrÀjÀdhirÀja” and founded the Gupta era in 335 BCE. The Chronology of Ancient Kashmir Kashmir had a great tradition of recording history since ancient times. Presently, Kalhaõa’s RÀjataraðgiõÁ is the most significant source for the history of ancient Kashmir. Kalhaõa himself states that he studied the NÁlamata PurÀõa and the records of eleven chroniclers. He refers to Suvrata’s RÀjakathÀ, Kœemendra’s NÃpÀvalÁ, HelÀrÀja’s PÀrthivÀvali, etc. and although he appears to have sincerely attempted to correct the errors in the records of the authentic history of Kashmir, he could not avoid a few inaccuracies in his presentation. Nevertheless, the RÀjataraôgiõÁ is a goldmine of information about the history of ancient Kashmir.

The Great Bear was in MaghÀ constellation around 3176-3076 BCE and not around 2448 BCE. It seems that the statement of the occurrence of the MahÀbhÀrata war around 2448 BCE was inserted in RÀjataraôgiõÁ during the 15th and 16th centuries when it was updated. Indians almost forgot the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king (583 BCE) and knew only the epoch of the death of the Œaka king (78 CE) by the 11th century CE. Some scholars also were confused with the statement of VÃddha Garga i.e. “add 2526 years to the Œaka era (583 BCE) to get the epoch of the YudhiÈÇhira era” and calculated back 2526 years from the ŒÀlivÀhana era (78 CE) to arrive at the date of YudhiÈÇhira in 2448 BCE.

    "content": ", the Œaka era commenced in 583 BCE whereas the ŒÀlivÀhana era commenced in 78 CE. Kalhaõa mentions that 1070 years had elapsed in the Œaka era at the time of his writing. Historians mistakenly believed in the one epoch of 78 CE and concluded that Kalhaõa flourished around 1148 CE. Actually, Kalhaõa wrote RÀjataraôgiõÁ in Œaka 1070 elapsed (487-488 CE) and not in ŒÀlivÀhana 1070 (1148 CE). Thus, Kalhaõa flourished in the 5th century CE and not in the 12th century CE. Kalhaõa covered the history of Kashmir from 3147 BCE to 449 CE, a total period of 3596 years. He ends the history of ancient Kashmir when king SiÚhadeva completes his 22nd regnal year in the 25th year of the\n342 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Laukika era i.e. 449 CE (SamÀdvÀviÚœatÁ rajyÀvÀpteÍ prÀgbhÂbhujo gatÀÍ |TavatyevÀpta-rÀjasya paðcaviÚœati-vatsare|| ).16 He states that Gonanda III lived 2330 years before the reign of SiÚhadeva (449 CE) i.e. 1881 BCE (PrÀyastritÁya-GonandÀdÀrabhya œaradÀm tadÀ| dve sahasre gate triÚœadadhikam ca œatatrayam || )17and 52 kings reigned for 1266 years prior to Gonanda III i.e. starting from 3147 BCE (VarÈÀõÀm dvÀdaœaœatÁ ÈaÈÇiÍ Èaçbhiœca saÚyutÀ| BhÂbhujÀm kÀlasaôkhyÀyÀm tadvÀpaðcÀœato matÀ|| ).18 Kalhaõa’s chronology of 3596 years is only indicative in nature as he could not provide the duration of the reign of some kings. Kalhaõa states that JarÀsandha, the king of Magadha requested help from Gonanda I during the conflict with Mathura and Gonanda I seized Matura with his massive forces. “SÀhÀyakÀrthamÀhÂto JarÀsandhena BandhunÀ| Sa saÚrurodha kaôsÀrer MathurÀm pÃthubhirbalaiÍ|| ”19 It is evident that Gonanda I was a contemporary of JarÀsandha of the BÃhadratha dynasty and Kaôsa of the Mathura kingdom. According to the PurÀõas, JarÀsandha’s son Sahadeva was the king of Magadha and died in the MahÀbhÀrata war. As discussed earlier, the MahÀbhÀrata war quite likely occurred around 3128 BCE and JarÀsandha’s grandson SomapÁ became the king of Magadha after the MahÀbhÀrata war. Thus, the time of Gonanda I and JarÀsandha can be fixed around 3175-3140 BCE. It is difficult to reconstruct the chronology of ancient Kashmir prior to the reign of the KarkoÇa dynasty given by Kalhaõa because there is no epigraphic or literary evidence available to fix certain dates. Undoubtedly the kings mentioned by Kalhaõa were the real rulers of Kashmir but the chronology needs further research. However, we can fix certain historical events. Kalhaõa states that three TuruÈka kings namely HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka ruled Kashmir and founded three cities named HuÈkapura, JuÈkapura and KaniÈkapura. He also states that 150 years have elapsed from the MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha during the reign of these three kings. “TadÀ BhagavataÍ ŒÀkyasiÚhasya parinirvÃteÍ| asmin mahilokadhÀtau sÀrdham varÈaœatam hyagÀt|| ”20\n343 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA As discussed in",

    "content": ", Buddha likely attained MahÀparinirvÀõa around 2134-2133 BCE considering the Aœoka mentioned in the Buddhist literature as a Kashmir king. According to ancient Buddhist sources, the Kashmir king Aœoka ascended the throne 100 years after the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha and Kalhaõa tells us that HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka began their reign 150 years after the date of nirvÀõa of Buddha. In CE The birth of Buddha 2214-2213 BCE The MahÀparinirvÀõa of Buddha 2134-2133 BCE Aœoka 2034-2000 BCE Jaloka 2000-1990 BCE DÀmodara II 1990-1984 BCE HuÈka 1984-1960 BCE JuÈka 1960-1950 BCE KaniÈka 1950-1910 BCE Abhimanyu 1910-1881 BCE Gonanda III 1881 BCE Modern historians refer to the king KaniÈka as KuÈÀõa but Kalhaõa refers to them as the descendants of TuruÈka dynasty (Te TuruÈkÀnvayodbhÂtÀÍ).21 Interestingly, Alberuni records that Hindus had Turk kings residing in Kabul who were said to be of Tibetan origin. Barhatkin was the first king and more than sixty generations ruled under the title of Shahiya of Kabul.22 Most probably HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka were TuruÈka kings of Tibetan origin. According to Kalhaõa, they patronised Buddhism and constructed Buddhist monasteries. We also learn from Kalhaõa that when Hiraõya, the king of Kashmir died issueless, the ministers reported the matter to their emperor VikramÀditya of Ujjain., also known as Harsha,23 with a plea to choose a fitting successor. VikramÀditya contemplated a whole night as to who would be the most appropriate person to sit on the throne of Kashmir and finally named MÀtÃgupta, the learned poet and administrator as the right candidate and thus did MÀtÃgupta become the king of Kashmir and went on to rule for five years. As it is an established fact that VikramÀditya, also known as Harsha flourished in the 1st century BCE\n344 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA and appointed MÀtÃgupta as king of Kashmir in the last decade of his life, the period of MÀtÃgupta can be fixed at the end of 1st century BCE. The chronology of the Karkota dynasty and the later Kashmir kings given by Kalhaõa can be an authentic historical account because it covers only a period of 500 years before his lifetime. I have reconstructed the chronology of the KarkoÇa dynasty and the later Kashmir kings based on the following historical facts. \u0002 LalitÀditya MuktÀpÁda was the contemporary (probably, senior contemporary) of KÀnyakubja king of Yaœovarman (30-91 CE). \u0002 Kalhaõa mentions that AjitapÁda, the king of the KarkoÇa dynasty reigned in the year 89 of the Laukika era (Ekonanavate varÈe).24 \u0002 King Yaœaskara died on the 3rd tithi of the dark fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in the 24th year of the Laukika era i.e. 24th Aug 248 CE.25 \u0002 Parvagupta ascended the throne on the 10th tithi of the dark fortnight of PhÀlguna month in the 24th year of the Laukika era i.e. 24th Feb 249 CE and died on the 13th tithi of the dark fortnight of °ÈÀçha month in the 26th year of the Laukika era i.e. 15thJun 250 CE.26 \u0002 Kœemagupta died on the 9th tithi of the bright fortnight of PauÈa month in the 34th year of the Laukika era i.e. 21stDec 258 CE.27 \u0002 Tribhuvanagupta became king on the 12th tithi of the bright fortnight of MÀrgaœirÈa month in the 49th year of the Laukika era i.e. 9th Nov 273 CE and died on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of MÀrgaœirÈa month in the 51st year of the Laukika era i.e. 10th Nov 275 CE.28 \u0002 DiddÀ ascended the throne in the 56th year of the Laukika era i.e. 280 CE and died on the 8th tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in the 79th year of the Laukika era i.e. 7th Aug 303 CE.29 \u0002 HarirÀja ascended the throne on the 1st tithi of the bright fortnight of °ÈÀçha month in the 4th year of the Laukika era i.e. 26th May 328 CE.30\n345 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA \u0002 Kœemendra writes in the colophon to the “SamayamÀtrikÀ” that he completed that work during the reign of Ananta in the 25th year of the Laukika era. \u0002 Bilhaõa, the author of VikramÀôkadevacaritam, mentions three Kashmir kings namely Anantadeva, Kalaœa and Harshadeva and that he left Kashmir in the reign of king Kalaœa. He was in VÀrÀõasÁ where the Chedi king Karõa was ruling (389-419 CE) and when he reached DhÀrÀ, he was extremely distraught on learning of the demise of the great king Bhoja (around 394 CE). \u0002 Harshadeva died on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of BhÀdrapada month in the 77th year of the Laukika era i.e. 31st July 401 CE.31 The Chronology of Later Kashmir kings (99 BCE to 449 CE): Duration In CE Y M D KarkoÇa Dynasty (4th Taraôga) 1.

The famous poets DÀmodaragupta, UdbhaÇa BhaÇÇa, Manoratha, Œaôkhadatta, Chataka and Sandhimat were in the court of JayÀpÁda (52-83 CE). King AvantivarmÀ (156-184 CE) was the patron of °nandavardhana and RatnÀkara. The great engineer named Suyya was the minister of King Avantivarma. He founded the city of Suyyapura (Sopore). Jayanta BhaÇÇa, the author of NyÀyamaðjarÁ, refers to the king ŒaôkaravarmÀ (184-202 CE). Jayanta BhaÇÇa’s son Abhinanda wrote the YogavÀsiÈÇha RÀmÀyaõa that contains a laudatory reference to the king Yaœaskara of Kashmir (239-248 CE). Abhinanda versified BÀõabhaÇÇa’s KÀdaÚbarÁ, also known as KÀdaÚbarÁkathÀsÀra. The KathÀsaritsÀgara, the largest collection of stories in the world and twice as long as the Iliad and Odyssey put together, was written by Somadeva for the edification of RÀjðÁ SÂryamatÁ, the wife of King Anantadeva (328-363 CE). Kœemendra, the famous author of the BÃhatkathÀmaðjarÁ, was the senior contemporary of Somadeva. Kœemendra also wrote ”SamayamÀtrikÀ”during the reign of Ananta in the 25th year of the Laukika era i.e. 349 CE. Kalhaõa, the son of Champakaprabhu, wrote RÀjataraôgiõÁ in 8 Taraôgas (chapters) containing 7783 verses in the year 1070 (487 CE) of the epoch of the coronation of the Œaka king. He covered approximately 3596 years of the history of Kashmir from 3147 BCE to 449 CE or from the time of King Gonanda I to the 22nd regnal year of king SiÚhadeva. He narrates the history of 3450 years from the MahÀbhÀrata era to 303 CE in just 2645 verses whereas he covers the detailed history of 146 years from 303 CE to 449 CE in 5135 verses. According to Kalhaõa, RÀni DiddÀ died on 9th Aug 303 CE. She had two brothers named UdayarÀja and KÀntirÀja. Kalhaõa provided the history of the descendants of UdayarÀja who ruled from 303 CE to 401 CE in the 7th Taraôga containing 1732 verses whereas he covers the history of the descendants of KÀntirÀja from 401 CE to 449 CE in the 8th Taraôga containing 3406 verses. Evidently, he was an eyewitness to a majority of the historical events narrated in the 8th Taraôga. Almost a 1000 years after the time of Kalhaõa, JonarÀja wrote “RÀjÀvalÁ” or the 2nd RÀjataraôgiõÁ in 1334 verses covering the history of\n348 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Kashmir from 1154 CE to 1412 CE. JonarÀja died in the 35th year of the Laukika era i.e. 1459 CE and his pupil Œrivara Pandita wrote “JainarÀjataraôgiõÁ” or 3rdRÀjataraôgiõÁ in four Taraôgas containing 2249 verses covering the history of the period 1412 CE to 1477 CE. Later, PrÀjyabhaÇÇa and Œuka authored “RÀjÀvalipiÇaka” or the 4th RÀjataraôgiõÁ in 950 verses covering the history of the period 1477 CE till the time of the conquest of Kashmir by the Mughal king Akbar. PrÀjyabhaÇÇa recorded the historical account up to the year 89 of the Laukika era i.e. 1513 CE and Œuka has completed it up to the conquest of Kashmir by Akbar. The historical account given by JonarÀja, Œrivara, PrÀjyabhaÇÇa and Œuka is mostly about the Muslim rulers. JonarÀja describes the reign of the last Hindu kings from 1154 CE to 1338 CE and briefly touches fifteen Hindu Kings in only 348 verses out of a total of 1334 verses comprising his chronicle. We learn that the Muslim ruler Zain-ul-Abdin asked ŒriyyabhaÇÇa, his Chief of all the courts of Justice, to write the history of the Kashmir kings from where Kalhaõa had left off. ŒriyyabhaÇÇa, in turn, selected JonarÀja for this work. JonarÀja was an admirer of Zain-ul-Abdin because he got justice in his favour in a land dispute. JonarÀja’s main duty was to not only record the detailed historical account of the Muslim Rulers and King Zain-ul-abdin but also to justify the Muslim rulers as Kœatriyas. He states that Shah Mir, the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, was a Kœatriya descended from Arjuna whose ancestors had taken up Islam. JonarÀja was not a historian like Kalhaõa who studied various chronicles to present the chronology of the kings of Kashmir. By his time, only the epoch of the death of Œaka king (78 CE) which is also known as the ŒÀlivÀhana era was known. Thus, JonarÀja ignorantly believed that Kalhaõa lived in 1148 CE and picked up the thread from 1148 CE to ensure continuity in his chronicle. Kalhaõa ends his RÀjataraôgiõÁ with the statement that King SiÚhadeva was ruling in the 25th year of the Laukika era. JonarÀja mistakenly identified King JayasiÚhadeva of the 12th century CE as SiÚhadeva of the 5th century CE. In fact, JayasiÚhadeva ascended the throne in 1136 CE and died on the 12th tithi of the dark fortnight of PhÀlguna month in the year 30 of\n349 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA the Laukika era i.e. 12th March 1154 CE.32 Thus, JayasiÚhadeva completed only 18 or 19 regnal years whereas SiÚhadeva completed his 22nd regnal year in the 25th year of the Laukika era. JonarÀja presented the following chronology of the later kings of Kashmir. In CE 1. JayasiÚha 1154 CE 2. ParamÀõuka 1154-1164 CE 3. Varttideva 1164-1171 CE 4. Vopyadeva 1171-1180 CE 5. Jassaka 1180-1198 CE 6. Jagaddeva 1198-1213 CE 7. RÀjadeva 1213-1236 CE 8. SaôgrÀmadeva 1236-1252 CE 9. RÀmadeva 1252-1273 CE 10. Lakœmaõadeva 1273-1286 CE 11. SiÚhadeva 1286-1301 CE 12. Suhadeva or RÀmachandra 1301-1320 CE 13. Riðchana 1320-1323 CE 14. UdyÀnadeva 1323-1338 CE 15. KotarÀni 1338-1339 CE The last Kashmir ruler, Queen KotarÀni fought against all odds but the wicked Shah Mir compelled her to marry him. Finally, she gave up her fight and committed suicide by consuming poison on the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of ŒrÀvaõa month in the 15th year of the Laukika era i.e. 16th July 1339 CE.33 Thus, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir in 1339 CE. Kalhaõa started his chronology of Kashmir from the MahÀbhÀrata era (32nd century BCE) because none of the Kashmiri Hindu sources or other Hindu sources mentioned that the MahÀbhÀrata war occurred in the 653rd year of Kaliyuga. It seems that either JonarÀja or later scholars might have inserted the verses 49, 50 & 51 into the 1st Taraôga of RÀjataraôgiõÁ.",

    "content": "was originally written by VÃddha Garga as\n350 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA referred by VarÀhamihira. It is intriguing how Kalhaõa incorporated verse 56 in his work without referring to the author and also quoted irrelevantly. It would have been more appropriate to place verse 56 at 53 of the 1st Taraôga. It is also evident that someone has edited verse 52 and replaced the phrase “Laukikebde catuœÈaÈÇhe” or “Laukikebde catuœÈaÈÇhyÀm” with “Laukikebde caturviÚœe” because ŒÀlivÀhana 1070 (1148 CE) should be the 24th year in the Laukika era. Kalhaõa clearly mentions that king SiÚhadeva completed his 22nd regnal year in the 25th year of the Laukika era34 which means he wrote RÀjataraôgiõÁ after the 25th year of the Laukika era. Thus, it is wrong to say that the RÀjataraôgiõÁ was written in the 24th year of the Laukika era. In fact, Kalhaõa completed his work in Saka 1070 (487 CE) and in the 64th year of the Laukika era. We need to refer to the original and unedited manuscripts to confirm the authenticity of the text. It is also evident that a later scholar wrote the 44 verses at the end of the 8th Taraôga summarising the list of the kings of Kashmir. It is likely that a South Indian scholar wrote these verses because he compares the Taraôgas of RÀjataraôgiõÁ with the waves of the GodÀvarÁ River. Certainly, a Kashmiri poet such as Kalhaõa would not have compared them with the GodÀvarÁ. Now the question that arises is: if Kalhaõa had written the RÀjataraôgiõÁ in 487 CE what, then, was the history of Kashmir from 487 CE to 1154 CE? The most acceptable answer is that the 34 kings listed in Tarikh-i-Kashmir written in the Persian language by Mulla Ahmad Malik ruled during the early medieval period. Interestingly, Maulvi Hassan Shah (1832-1898 CE), the compiler of Tarikh-i-Hassan Kashmir, whose seventh ancestor was a Kashmiri Pandit named Ganesh Kaul, was a distinguished scholar in Persian and Arabic learning. He got a copy of Tarikh-i-Kashmir written by Mulla Ahmad of the 15th century CE during his visit to Rawalpindi. Interestingly, during the reign of Zain-ul-Abdin (1418-1470 CE), a search for old Sanskrit works was launched so that an updated version of the history of Kashmir could be brought out in the Persian language and the job was entrusted to the court poet, Mulla Ahmad Malik. It was\n351 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA a difficult job because the foolish and barbaric rulers of the Shah Mir dynasty had destroyed all the old books of the Hindus in 14th century CE. At that time, Mulla Ahmad had the names of 15 different RÀjataraôgiõÁs but only those of Kalhaõa, Kœemendra, Wachhulakar and Padmamihira could be traced. A few years later, some birch bark leaves of a RÀjataraôgiõÁ written by Pandit RatnÀkar were found by Mulla Ahmad with the help of PrÀja Pandit. The work of Ratnakara contained a list of 35 unknown kings and also 7 unknown kings who ruled over Kashmir. Mulla Ahmad had translated Ratnakara’s work into Persian, a copy of which was found by Hassan Shah in Rawalpindi.35 Hassan Shah claimed that he had borrowed the accounts of the 35 forgotten kings of Kashmir from the translation of Mulla Ahmad. It is surprising that the author of the NÁlamata PurÀõa of ancient times and Kalhaõa, who flourished at least 1000 years before Mulla Ahmad, could not unearth the names of the 35 forgotten kings who flourished between King Gonanda II and King Lava but Mulla Ahmed of the 15th century CE could discover them. Undoubtedly, Pandit Ratnakara lived much after Kalhaõa. It is very likely that Mulla Ahmad came by a list of the later kings who ruled in the early medieval period but could not accommodate them in the chronology because the date of Kalhaõa was erroneously fixed in the 12th century CE. Therefore, Mulla Ahmad erroneously placed the following 22 names of the later kings of Kashmir between King Gonanda II and King Lava.36 1. Harnadeva 2. RÀmadeva 3. VyÀsadeva 4. Darnadeva 5. SiÚhadeva 6. GopÀladeva 7. Vijayananda 8. Sukhadeva 9. RÀmÀnanda 10. Sandhiman\n352 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 11. Marahandeva and his brother Kamandeva 12. Chandradeva 13. °nandadeva 14. DÃptadeva 15. Harnamdeva 16. Sulkandeva 17. Sanya Dut 18. Maôgala Dut 19. Kœemendra 20. BhÁmasena 21. Indrasena 22. Sundarasena Again, the following 12 names of later Kashmiri kings were placed between King Sachinara or Sapanji Nar and King Aœoka. 1. Galkander 2. Baladeva 3. Nalsena 4. Gokarõa 5. Prahlada 6. Wazir Bambro 7. PratapaœÁla 8. Saôgramachandra 9. Alarak Chandra 10. Beramchandra 11. Raja Bibikhan 12. Bhagavanta Kashmiris say that kings belonging to the so-called PÀndava dynasty (the real name of the dynasty is not known) ruled over Kashmir for a long time and most of the historians are also in agreement with this. The proof of the kingdom of this dynasty is provided by archaeological finds which still exist in Kashmir. Most probably, the first 22 or 23 kings\n353 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA belonged to the so-called PÀndava dynasty and ruled over Kashmir between 487 CE to 1154 CE. The ruins on the Martand Plateau are popularly called “Pandav-Lar” or the building of the PÀndavas which was built by RÀmadeva, one of the descendants of the PÀndava dynasty. Interestingly, Nalsena in the Kashmiri language is synonymous with a person of abominable character and fittingly enough, it appears that King Nalsena was a cruel and oppressive king. “Lolare Bambro” is a favourite love song among the Kashmiris because the King Bambro fell madly in love with a woman named “Lolare”. Himal Nagi-Arjuna is also a popular love story in Kashmir.37 Mulla Ahmad also mentions seven more unknown kings of Kashmir named Tunjina, Sarabsena, Gandharvasena, Lachman, Surak, VajrÀditya and VainyÀditya or VinayÀditya and placed them along with RÀõÀditya who ruled for 300 years as stated by Kalhaõa. It is evident that Mulla Ahmad collected the names of the later Kashmir kings of the early medieval period from RatnÀkara’s work and erroneously filled the gaps in the chronology given by Kalhaõa. The works of RatnÀkara and Mulla Ahmad are now lost but undoubtedly, the 22 or 23 kings of the PÀndava dynasty, 12 kings starting from Galkander, Baldeva, Nalsena, Bambro etc. and 7 kings from Tunjina to Vinayaditya flourished during the period of 487 CE to 1154 CE. There is a need for serious research to determine the exact dates of these so-called unknown kings of Kashmir. In fact, many Persian scholars wrote the history of Kashmir but a record of extant Persian histories preserved in the Research and Publication Department of Jammu & Kashmir State, Srinagar, lists only seventeen works in manuscript form. The earliest among these is Tarikh- i-Kashmir of Sayyid Ali (1579 CE) and the most recent is Tarikh-i-Kabir of Ghulam Mohiuddin (1900 CE). Recently, Kashi Nath Pandit translated a Persian manuscript “Baharistan-i-ShÀhi” written by an anonymous author. Baharistan-i-ShÀhi is a political history of medieval Kashmir and mentions some unknown kings like VinayÀditya and RÀmadeva and certain unknown historical events of early medieval Kashmir. The translation of Kashi Nath Pandit provides glimpses of the history of early mediaeval Kashmir thus:\n354 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA King VinayÀditya and his successors: “His grandson VinayÀditya proceeded to conquer foreign lands and captured many cities; at last he came to a city in the East whose king was made to fear VinayÀditya; he consulted his ministers and nobles to seek their opinion in this matter. His senior ministers submitted to him that Ratnatir was a mighty king and they could not stand against him in battle. His chief minister told him that it was difficult to repel his attack. But now that the king had asked for his counsel, he would advise him to surrender to VinayÀditya. This would enrage him and he would order that his nose be chopped off which would be followed by his expulsion from the city. After his nose would be chopped off and following his expulsion [from the city], he would join the enemy and devise some plan of destroying him. When the enemy came to know of the minister’s affairs and the news reached VinayÀditya, he made him his associate in conquering the neighbouring lands. The crafty minister, full of deceit and guile as he was, led VinayÀditya to a route where no water was available for ten to twelve days [of their journey], and a fairly large number of his men and beasts perished. Seeing through the deceit and craftiness of the minister, VinayÀditya asked him what his objective was in [doing this]. The minister told him that he wanted to get rid of him so that the country of his king was spared the scourge that he was. When VinayÀditya heard this, he gave him a robe of honour and other rewards and also extended favour to his king. VinayÀditya then proceeded to the countries of Kesh and Bahrain where he met a disastrous defeat resulting in a heavy loss of men and material. Along with a handful of his followers, the king fell into the hands of the king of Bahrain who placed them all in the custody of his mother, so that she could keep an eye on them. One day VinayÀditya threatened her with dire consequences for her son. Completely bewildered, she asked him how his capacity for retaliation had grown during his captivity. Meanwhile, there blew a strong gale and he, as well as the mother of the king, embarked for Mabar (Malabar). In that place there was a man-eater and the king found himself unable to kill it. VinayÀditya put\n355 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA his left hand into the jaw of the lion and with his right hand rent it asunder, which surprised the king of Mabar. He summoned him to his presence and bestowed upon him robes of honour and other rewards and gave him his daughter in marriage. A large contingent of troops was despatched under his command to conquer the country of Pars. He brought those lands under his sway and totally subjugated their people. Then he went back to Kashmir to continue with his rule over that land................ Here the king reigned for seventy years. Then he handed over the reins of government to his son named Bardanatant. The kingship then passed on to Kashshil, and then to Rama Chand, and after his death to Onta Dev.” King Ram Dev and his successors: “During his days, there lived a king in India named Shri — who had a giant-like physique. He attacked the king of Kashmir, killed him and occupied his country. He [Shri] ruled for a hundred years. Towards the end [of his reign], he was attacked by Shri [Shir?] Akramadit, who wrested the city of Kashmir from him. He (Shri) was killed, leaving behind his minor daughter and son, who fled to a foreign country. For many years they lived in the hollow of a tree. In due course of time their progeny increased numerically. When asked about their antecedents, they said that they were the offspring of the tree. They also said that formerly there lived a king in India by the name of Shri Harsha Dev, who had given Kashmir to their ancestors. They then attended to the task of developing Kashmir. He and his descendants reigned for three hundred years. They were followed by the aforesaid Shri Akramadit. Then came Rama, the paternal uncle of Shiv Dev. He was attacked by the Mongol army. Under the orders of Qaan (Predecessor of Changhis Khan?), the commander of the troops [of Qaan] besieged the city of Kashmir and plundered its people. Ram Dev fled away on horseback with the enemy in hot pursuit but managed to escape by jumping into a river and swimming across to safety. The Mongols stayed on in Kashmir for six months, plundering and pillaging and finally, when they returned to their native land, Ram Dev re-entered Kashmir. He gained control over the kingdom, defeated the Mongols, and later on raised an army. When Miku Qaan (Predecessor\n356 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA of Changhis Khan?) came to know of it, he sent his troops under the command of Salinuyan to deal with Ram Dev. The city of Kashmir was once again attacked and its elders put to the sword or taken prisoner. After Ram Dev’s death, his brother, Laxma (Laxman) Dev, ascended the throne on the orders of Miku Qaan and Hulagu Qaan. Laxman Dev died in A.H. 531 (A.D. 1136), and was succeeded by Zeyeh Sehm Dev (Jayasimha Deva) as the lord of Kashmir. During his reign in A. H. 535 (A.D. 1140), Malla Chand, Raja of Nagarkot, came to Kashmir and after aligning himself with Zeyeh Sehm Dev, requested him to make him the commander of his troops. Zeyeh Sehm Dev reigned for about twenty-seven years and died in A. H. 555 (A.D. 1160). He was succeeded by his son Parmat Dev who reigned for nine years and six months till he died in A. H. 568 (A.D. 1172) and was succeeded by his son Vanta Dev, who reigned for nine years and two days till his death in A.H. 577 (A.D. 1181) when his son Bupeh (Vupeh) Dev succeeded him and remained in power for nine years, four months and two days till his death in A.H. 586 (A.D. 1190) and was followed by his son Zaseh Dev, who reigned for eighteen years and thirteen days until his death in A H. 604 (A.D. 1208) leaving his son Zageh Dev to ascend the throne and rule for fourteen years and two months till his death in A.H. 618 (A. D. 1221) when he was succeeded by his son Razeh Dev. During the days of Razeh Dev, Gaga Chand, a descendant of the house of the Chandas became the commander of his troops. While the earlier rulers of Kashmir had confined themselves to the territories of Kashmir and did not venture out to annex adjoining lands, Razeh Dev, on the advice of Gaga Chand, the commander of his troops subjugated and annexed the areas adjoining the kingdom of Kashmir; Gaga Chand built the fort of Gagangir in the pargana of Lar. Razeh Dev’s reign lasted twenty-three years, three months and twenty-nine days till his death in A.H. 641 (A.D. 1243), and was succeeded by his son Sangram Dev, during whose reign, Balad Chand, the son of Gaga Chand assumed command of his army and founded the locality of Bardi Mar in the city. When Sangram Dev constructed the town of Bejeh Belareh, Balad Chand founded Chandpuryar in that town.\n357 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Sangram Dev’s reign lasted sixteen years till his death in A.H. 657 (A.D. 1258); his son Ram Dev succeeded him and ruled for twenty-one years, one month and twelve days till his death in A.H. 678 (A.D. 1279) and was succeeded by his son Lachman Dev who ruled for thirteen years, three months and twelve days. The command of his troops was in the hands of Balad Chand’s son Sangram Chand. In A.H. 691 (A.D. 1293), Lachman Dev breathed his last and was succeeded by his son Simha Dev who reigned for fourteen years and six months and died in A.H. 705 (A.D. 1305). Then came his son Suh Dev who ruled for nineteen years, three months and twenty-five days. Their commander was Rama Chand the son of Sangram Chand.”38 Let us compare the genealogy and chronology of the later kings of Kashmir (1100-1300 CE) given by the Baharistan-i-ShÀhi and the RÀjataraôgiõÁ of JonarÀja. Baharistan-i-ShÀhi In CE JonarÀja In CE 1. Ram Dev — — 2. Laxman Dev (Brother of Ram Dev) 1136CE — — 3. Zeyeh Sehm Dev 1136-1162 CE JayasiÚhadeva 1154 CE 4.

Ram Dev 1258-1279 CE RÀmadeva 1252-1273 CE 12. Lachman Dev 1279-1293 CE Lakœmaõadeva 1273-1286 CE 11. Simha Dev 1293-1305 CE SiÚhadeva 1286-1301 CE 12. Suh Dev 1305 CE Suhadeva or RÀmachandra 1301-1320 CE It is evident that JayasiÚhadeva was the successor of Laxman Dev and ruled around 1136 to 1162 CE (or 1154 CE). The Mongol ruler Miku Khan invaded Kashmir and plundered the land for six months in the beginning of the 12th century CE, during the reign of Ram Dev. It is probable that Laxman Dev sought the help of Miku Khan to dethrone\n358 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA his brother Ram Dev. After the death of Ram Dev, Miku Khan interfered in the succession and coronated Laxman dev as the King of Kashmir. Laxman Dev died around 1136 CE and JayasiÚhadeva succeeded him. JonarÀja was ignorant of the epoch of the coronation of Œaka era (583 BCE) and ignorantly assumed that Kalhaõa wrote the history of Kashmir up to 1148 CE. He incorrectly identified SiÚhadeva of the 5th century CE as JayasiÚhadeva of the 12th century CE and stated that JayasiÚhadeva was the successor of Sussala. According to the Baharistan-i-ShÀhi, JayasiÚhadeva was Laxman Dev’s successor and ascended the throne in 1136 CE whereas Kalhaõa tells us that SiÚhadeva was the successor of Sussala, and completed his 22nd regnal year in the year 25 of the Laukika era i.e. 449 CE. Kalhaõa wrote his RÀjataraôgiõÁ in Œaka 1070 (487 CE) but JonarÀja ignorantly assumed that Kalhaõa wrote it in ŒÀlivÀhana 1070 (1148 CE). Actually, Kalhaõa had no knowledge about the invasion of Miku Khan, the Mongol ruler, the plundering of Kashmir by the Mongols for six months during the reign of Ram Dev and the coronation of Laxman Dev by the orders of Miku Khan. Kalhaõa narrates the history of the last 48 years in the 8th Taraôga comprising 3403 verses but he mentions nothing about the historical events narrated by the Baharistan-i-ShÀhi. It is evident that Kalhaõa did not belong to ŒÀlivÀhana 1070 (1148 CE) but lived in Œaka 1070 (487 CE). There is a serious need for research to write the forgotten history of Kashmir from 487 CE to 1100 CE. The Chronology of Ancient Nepal The Paœupati inscription of Jayadeva II claims that King LiccÍavi, the progenitor of the LiccÍavi dynasty, was born after eight other kings who came after King Daœaratha passed on. (Œrimattuôgarathstato DaœarathaÍ putraiÀcha pautraissamam, rÀjðoÈÇÀvaparan vihÀya parataÍœrimÀnbhÂlliccÍaviÍ|).39 Thus, the history of ancient Nepal is as old as that of ancient India. We learn from the VaÚœÀvalis of the kings of Nepal that the chronology of the kings of ancient Nepal starts from 3800-3700 BCE. Undoubtedly, these vaÚœÀvalis contain many elements of historical truth but the chronology needs to be reconstructed based on archaeological, epigraphic and other literary evidences. In 1884 CE,\n359 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji presented the chronology of ancient Nepal based on the ParvatÁya RÀjavaÚœÀvali, composed by a Buddhist monk of Lalitapattana in the 17th century.40 According to the first date recorded in the ParvatÁya RÀjavaÚœÀvali, the 4th SomavaÚœi king Paœuprekœadeva restored the Paœupati temple and brought settlers from India in the year 1234 of Kaliyuga era i.e. 1868 BCE. The KirÀta dynasty ruled over Nepal for 1118 years (before the kings of SomavaÚœa) and the GopÀla dynasty for 521 years before the KirÀta dynasty. Thus, the rule of the GopÀla dynasty commenced by 3700 BCE and that of the KirÀta dynasty around 3200 BCE. The SomavaÚœi kings succeeded the KirÀtas around 1900 BCE. According to the ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali, the KirÀta dynasty was ruling in Nepal during the MahÀbhÀrata war. Jitedasti, the 7th king of KirÀtas, supported the PÀndavas in the MahÀbhÀrata war but lost his life. Interestingly, the Buddhist author claimed that Buddha came to Nepal during the reign of Jitedasti. He also stated that Aœoka married off his daughter ChÀrumati to a Kshatriya DevapÀla during the reign of Sthunko, the 14th king of the Kiratas. Apparently, the Buddhist author concocted these claims to prove that Buddha flourished during the MahÀbhÀrata era; hence, we can ignore these claims. SomavaÚœa was succeeded by SÂryavaÚœa in 1713 BCE. BhÀskaravarman, the 5th king of the SomavaÚœis, was childless and adopted BhÂmivarman who founded the rule of SÂryavaÚœa in the year 1389 of the Kaliyuga era i.e. 1713 BCE. BhÂmivarman’s son Chandravarman and subsequently his grandson Jayavarman succeeded him. In 1992, some workers who were digging a trench for the foundation of a house in Maligoan village in Eastern Kathmandu, discovered a life size standing male figure carved in sandstone. This sculpture is the earliest archaeological discovery in the history of Nepal. This sculpture was actually the donation of a king named Jayavarman as written in an inscription on its pedestal. According to historians, the inscription is written in KuÈÀõa BrÀhmi script and can be read as follows:\n360 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA “Sam*vat a7 gri- pa 7 d(i)va pka mahÀ-rÀ-jasya jaya varm(m)a(n*aÍ*)” [In) the year 107, (on) the 4th (lunar) day of the 7th fortnight of the summer (season), of the great King Jaya Varman.]41 This inscription is dated in the year 107 of unknown era. Two dubious scholars from Italy named Angelo Andrea Di Castro and Riccardo Garbini attempted to put the reading of the date as 207 so that the antiquity of the sculpture can be brought down by a hundred years but fortunately nobody agreed with them. Though historians accepted the year to be 107, they wrongly concluded that the inscription was dated in ŒÀlivÀhana 107 (185 CE). There is no evidence to prove that the Œaka era or the ŒÀlivÀhana era was in vogue in ancient Nepal. As discussed in Chapters 6 & 7, the LiccÍavi inscriptions were dated in an ancient era or the LiccÍavi era that commenced around 966 BCE. Evidently, Jayavarman was a pre-LiccÍavi king. It seems that the Buddhist author of ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali clubbed the list of SuryavaÚœi kings and the list of LiccÍavi kings into one and erroneously attached the surname “Varman” to the names of the LiccÍavi kings. None of the LiccÍavi inscriptions used the surname “Varman” for LiccÍavi kings. Therefore, Jayavarman cannot be identified as an early LiccÍavi king. Evidently, the lineage of SuryavaÚœa kings was different from the lineage of LiccÍavi kings. As recorded in the VaÚœÀvali, BhÂmivarman, the grandfather of Jayavarman, ascended the throne in the year 1389 (1713 BCE) of the Kaliyuga era. It appears that BhÂmivarman founded a “SuryavaÚœa era” in commemoration of his coronation. Thus, Jayavarman was ruling in the year 107 of SuryavaÚœa era i.e. 1606 BCE and was a contemporary of the Nanda kings of Magadha. Most probably, the SuryavaÚœa kings ruled over Nepal from 1713 BCE to 966 BCE whereas the LiccÍavi kings ruled over Nepal starting from 966 BCE.\n361 THE PURANIC CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA The chronology of the LiccÍavi kings as discussed in",

According to the ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali, Vasantadeva (Vasantadeva II?) ascended the throne around Kaliyuga 2800 (301 BCE). It is difficult to say anything conclusively about the successor of Jayadeva II because no epigraphic evidence is available to reconstruct the further chronology of the LiccÍavi dynasty. Probably, the LiccÍavis became feudatories of the Gupta Kings after Jayadeva II as mentioned in the Allahabad stone inscription of Samudragupta. ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali tells\n362 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA us that Viœvadeva was the last LiccÍavi king who married off his daughter to Aôœuvarman II of ThÀkuri dynasty. Aôœuvarman II ascended the throne in Kaliyuga 3000 (101 BCE) and transferred the seat of Government from KailÀœakÂÇa to Madhyalakhu.42According to Sumatitantra, MÀnadeva SaÚvat commenced in Œaka 498 elapsed (85-84 BCE) but at present, there is no evidence to prove that a LiccÍavi King MÀnadeva II ruled around 85 BCE. Probably, this era was named after MÀnadeva I to immortalise the name of the greatest king of the LiccÍavi dynasty. According to the ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali, VÁradeva of the ThÀkuri dynasty became king in Kaliyuga 3400 (298 CE) and Varadeva was ruling around Kaliyuga 3623 (521 CE). GuõakÀmadeva built KÀntipura, the modern Kathmandu at the junction of the rivers Vagmati and ViÈõumati in Kaliyuga 3824 (722 CE). SadÀœivadeva built KÁrtipura on a hill south- west of Kathmandu and a new golden roof for the Paœupati temple in Kaliyuga 3851 (749 CE). Jayadevamalla founded a new era named as the Newari era. There is a serious need for research to reconstruct the chronology of the later kings of Nepal who flourished after 85 BCE. Some historians concluded that the Newari era and Nepala Samvat are identical and that both commenced in 880 CE. The ParvatÁya VaÚœÀvali tells us that Nanyadeva of the Karnataka dynasty conquered Nepal in the year 811 or Nepali Samvat 9. According to another VaÚœÀvali, Nanyadeva came to Nepal with a big army in the year 948 and in Nepali SaÚvat 230-231 (varÈe mite NÀga-samudra-nandaiÍ 948 Nepali samvat Kha-guõÀkœimÀne 230, Œri Nanyadevo bahu-sainya-yuktaÍ KarõÀÇakÀdatra samÀyayau saÍ |).43 There is a need for further research to establish whether Nepali SaÚvat and the Newari era are identical or two different eras and also the exact epoch of these eras. \u0002\n363 Vedic civilization is the only ancient civilization with extant literature. The early works such as the hymns of the Rigveda, Yajurveda, SÀmaveda and Atharva Veda were composed by Vedic seers during the early and mid-Vedic periods. It appears that minor ideological differences, as in the performance of Vedic rituals, recitation of Vedic Mantras and the like led to the evolution of 1131 (or more) branches of the Vedas but unfortunately, only 13 branches of that great body of literature is available today.

A Eurocentric approach and the resultant bias marked the Vedic studies undertaken by amateur colonial scholars and western historians, who, lacking the traditional wisdom and knowledge of the Sanskrit language, deliberately introduced distorted views and concocted a number of inaccurate and confounding theories about Vedic civilization; as no other motive can be established, one must surmise that this was done only with the objective of establishing the Eurocentric history of civilization. As the first of the means to achieve this end, they used artifice and artful deceit to propound the ‘theory’, the myth of the Aryan invasion",

    "content": "The Antiquity of Vedic Civilization\n364 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA and on that ‘basis’, arbitrarily fixed the date of the Vedas around 1500 BCE. Eminent Indian historians of the post-independence era, schooled in the Western methods, unquestioningly accepted and internalised these false bases and went further on to introduce more misinterpretations that led to greater divergence from the truth. Surprisingly, a majority of Indian historians seldom pursued the independent study of original sources, presumably owing to the lack of in-depth knowledge of Sanskrit. Consequently, Indian historical research continued to progress on the basis of secondary sources and furthermore, was vastly influenced by political patronage of certain selected ideologies. A few Western Indologists like Hermann Jacobi (1850-1937 CE) and a few Indian scholars like Balagangadhar Tilak presented certain astronomical references found in the Vedas to prove that the antiquity of Vedic literature lay well before 1500 BCE but colonial historians suppressed these facts without any logical explanation. In 1908, Hermann Jacobi, the German scholar, established that certain hymns of the Rigveda were definitely datable around 4500 BCE.1 Balagangadhar Tilak published a book entitled “The Orion; or, Researches into the Antiquity of the Vedas” in 1893 and established that the Rigveda was composed around 4500 BCE. John Playfair, the Scottish mathematician demonstrated in 1789 CE that the epoch of the astronomical observations recorded in the tables still in use among Hindu astrologers had to be 4300 BCE. Eurocentric and intellectually dishonest Western scholars and their followers simply brushed aside these facts and fraudulently propounded the fanciful, unreal ‘theory’ of Aryan invasion in order to establish the historical supremacy of Europe. It is a well-known fact that the Rigveda is the oldest text in the world but its antiquity has been grossly underestimated. Vedic civilisation was the most ancient civilisation and there is compelling evidence to claim that the region of Sapta Sindhu (Seven rivers i.e. Saraswati, five rivers of Punjab and Sindhu) was indeed the cradle of human civilisation. I cite the following details from various research works which validate the fact that the antiquity of Vedic civilisation goes back to 10,000 BCE.\n365 Archaeological, Epigraphic and Literary evidence 1. Dr. BG Siddhartha, the Director of the BM Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad, was the first to establish hard archaeological evidence2 in this regard. According to him, recent archaeological findings in the South-eastern Anatolian region (part of modern Turkey) have completely stumped historians who believed that the earliest civilisation with Megalithic elements was from around 4000 BCE that is Sumer and Egypt. According to history textbooks, earlier civilizations ought to belong to the Neolithic time. However the excavations at Nevali Cori and Gobekli Tepe (both within a few kilometres of each other) near Sanlurfa (in Turkey, on the Syrian border) have turned sacrosanct facts of history books on their head. Among the many sculpted artefacts that were unearthed here, there are, amazingly, the head of a Vedic priest, complete with the Œikha as well as several pillars and structures embellished with all the astronomical motifs that find mention in the Rigveda and are indicative of a high degree of artistry. A Vedic priest, Relief of Garuda with Sun with the Œikha and Scorpion According to Wikipedia, “The tell of Gobekli Tepe includes two phases of ritual use dating back to the 10th-8th millennium BCE. During the first phase, circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected. More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys. Each pillar has a height of up to 6 m (20 ft.) and a weight of up to 20 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the bedrock. In the THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n366 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA second phase, the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime. Topographic scans have revealed that other structures next to the hill, awaiting excavation, probably date to 14-15 thousand years ago”. It is evident that the archaeological findings at Gobekli Tepe and Nevali Cori clearly indicate that early Vedic civilisation extended up to South-eastern Anatolian region and its antiquity goes beyond 10,000 BCE. 2. In 2001, the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) discovered a submerged city in the Gulf of Khambhat. This site is located 20 km from the Gujarat coast, spread over 9 km and at a depth of 20-40 metres. It was an urban settlement containing spaced dwellings, a granary, a bath, a citadel and a drainage system. Among the artefacts recovered were a piece of wood, pottery shards, weathered stones initially described as hand tools, fossilized bones and a tooth. The piece of wood was carbon-dated and found to be 9,500 years old. This site is said to have been submerged 7500 years ago or around 5500 BCE but was quite likely inhabited since 9500 BCE. 3. According to the latest Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report, the mounds at Bhirrana village, on the banks of the Ghaggar River, in Fatehabad (near Hisar) district of Haryana date back to 7570 BCE. On the basis of radio-metric dating from Bhirrana, the cultural remains go back to the time bracket of 7300 BCE. Thus, the site of Bhirrana was the oldest city in the Indus-Saraswati civilisation, older than the site of Mehargarh (in Pakistan) dated around 7000 BCE. 4. The traces of wheat-based and barley-based cultivation found at Mehargarh indicates that the agrarian revolution had started before 7000 BCE. Some samples of rice from the archaeological sites Lahuradeva and Jhusi have been found to be dated around 7000-6000 BCE. The archaeological study of sites like Mehargarh, Kot Diji, Nausharo, Dholavira, Lothal etc. clearly indicates the development of civilization since 7000 BCE.\n367 5. The Indus-Sarasvati civilisation (4000-3000 BCE) was also inherited from Vedic civilisation; fire-altars were discovered at Harappa, Lothal, Kalibangan, etc. It is a proven fact that the cities of the Indus-Sarasvati civilisation gradually declined (not suddenly collapsed) due to the drying up of the Sarasvati River around 4000-3000 BCE. Western scholars mischievously concocted the theory that Dravidians were the original inhabitants of the cities of Indus- Sarasvati civilisation and that these cities were plundered and destroyed by the invading Aryans. They also argued that the people of the Indus-Sarasvati civilisation were completely ignorant of the domestication of horses and that the Aryans introduced it but this argument has fallen flat by the discovery of horse remains at Surkotada, a site located 160 km north-east of Bhuj in the district of Kutch, Gujarat. Interestingly, I had an opportunity to meet the legendary archaeologist Shri AK Sharma who discovered the horse remains at Surkotada. I was on election duty as Expenditure Observer in Mahasamand district, Chattisgarh in April 2014 and Shri AK Sharma was supervising the excavations at Rajim. He told me that when he found the horse remains in the 1970s, his seniors could not believe it. They recommended that the government ought to permit European archaeologists to carry out the study of the excavations at Surkotada. Shri Sharma opposed the decision tooth and nail. Consequently, the team of European archaeologists had to pack up and leave. After ten years, one French scholar visited the office of Shri AK Sharma in the 1980s and verified or rather certified that those were indeed horse remains. Finally, the ASI felicitated Shri AK Sharma ten years after the date of his discovery of horse remains. This shows how some senior officers (intellectual slaves of the West) of the ASI conspired to brush aside this invaluable archaeological find of horse remains to protect the fraudulent theory of Aryan invasion. THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n368 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 6. The “Zend Avesta”, the sacred text of Zoroastrianism has extremely close cultural and linguistic similarities with Rigveda; the word “Zend” itself derived from the Sanskrit word “CÍandas”. 7. Vedic deities such as Mitra, Varuõa, Indra and NÀsatya (Aœvins) were invoked in a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni dated around 1380 BCE. The kingdom of the Mitanni dynasty that ruled in the land of the Hurrians was located in the upper Euphrates-Tigris basin that is now part of northern Iraq, Syria and south-eastern Turkey. The Mitanni’s north-western border with the Hattian kingdom of the Hittites was fluid and constantly subject to aggression. Two rival kings, Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, concluded a peace treaty invoking Vedic deities. It is probable that the Mittanis and the Hittites were descendants of the Gobekli Tepe and Nevali Cori civilisation. A chariot horse training text authored by Kikkuli and written in the Hittite language dated around 1400 BCE includes Sanskrit numeral compounds such as aiga (eka), tera (tri), panza (pañca), satta (sapta), nawa (nava), vartana etc. Genome studies The recent genome studies of Indians have provided vital clues about how the Indian population has come to resemble today’s complex milieu. Shri Sanjeev Sanyal has logically presented the outcome of these studies in his book “Land of the Seven Rivers”. In his words, India has been a traditional home for many populations that have lived in the country for a very long time and there has been a great deal of internal migration over thousands of years. So, where a group is found today may be very different from where it originated. It is proven in the genome studies in 2006 that India’s population mix has been broadly stable for a very long time and that there has been no major injection of Central Asian genes for over 10,000 years. This means that even if there had been a large- scale influx of so-called Aryans or Indo-Europeans, it would have taken place more than 10,000 years ago. A study led by David Reich of the Harvard Medical School published in Nature in 2009 suggests that the bulk of the Indian population can be\n369 explained by the mixture of two ancestral groups – the Ancestral South Indian (ASI) and the Ancestral North Indian (ANI). Undoubtedly, ANI genes have a larger share in North India and account for over 70 percent of the genes of Kashmiri Pandits and Sindhis. However, it is interesting to note that ANI genes have a large, about 40-50 per cent, share even in South India and among tribal groups of central India. As a matter of fact, there is no pure population of Ancestral South Indian. Incidentally, there are also no pure Ancestral North Indians. It is evident that David Reich mischievously attempted to distort the findings of genome studies to re-establish the old Aryan-Dravidian racial theory. Indians are dealing with genetic mingling that started well over 10,000 years ago and are closely related to each other. It is totally absurd splitting hair over who is more ANI (so-called Aryan) and who is more ASI (so-called Dravidian). Interestingly, most of the evidence is centred on a gene mutation called R1a1 or a sub-group R1a1a. This gene is common in North India and among East Europeans such as the Czechs, Poles and Lithuanians. There are smaller concentrations in South Siberia, Tajikistan, north- eastern Iran and in Kurdistan of Iraq. However, the gene is rare among Western Europeans, Western Iranians and through many parts of Central Asia. A study by Peter Underhill in 2010 found that the oldest strain of the R1a1a branch was concentrated in the Gujarat-Sindh-Western Rajasthan area, suggesting that this was close to the origin of this genetic group. European carriers of R1a1a also carried a further mutation, M458, which is not found at all in their Asian cousins. Since the M458 mutation is estimated to be at least 8000 years old, the two population groups appear to have separated much earlier. Thus, the genetic linkages between North Indians and East Europeans are best explained by the sharing of a distant common ancestor, perhaps from 12,000 BCE when the last Ice Age ended. The most common lineage in Western Europe is R1b. This is related to R1a1 and possibly also originated in the Persian Gulf area but the two lineages separated a long time ago, probably during or before the last Ice Age. Compared to R1a1, India has relatively low concentrations of R1b. The genetic and cultural links between North Indians and eastern THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n370 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Iranians are due to a continued migration of some lineages north- westward from India, probably from 10,000 BCE. The archaeological findings at Gobekli Tepe and Nevali Cori (in Turkey on the Syrian border) also clearly indicate this. Undoubtedly, some lineages of early Vedic civilisation moved westward to Iran and beyond from the end of the last Ice Age. There is absolutely no genetic evidence to prove that some tribes moved from the west to east. Astronomical References in Vedic literature (Collected from research articles of Dr. KD Abhyankar, Dr. BG Sidharth, Dr. RN Iyengar, Dr. Subhash Kak and many other scholars) 1. The TaittirÁya BrÀhmaõa (3.1.2) mentions that Aja ekapÀd (or the asterism PÂrvabhÀdrapada [Pegasus]) is exactly at the East point; this must have occurred around 10,000 BCE. 2. The SÂrya SiddhÀnta and BÃihat SaÉhitÀ of VarÀhamihira (156-74 BCE) mention the astronomical event “RohiõÁ-œakaÇa-bheda” which means the cutting of the Taurus constellation by Saturn or Mars or a comet, etc. Such events occurred several times during the period 9860 BCE to 9339 BCE and also occurred once in 5284 BCE. The next occurrence of RohiõÁ-œakaÇa-bheda will be only after 10,000 CE. 3. TaittirÁya SaÉhita (6.5.3) mentions that the asterism KÃittikÀ (Pleides) was the North Star and that is at Winter Solstice; this occurred around 8530 BCE. 4. According to BG Sidharth, the Tripura legend of the Vedas refers to a date around 7300 BCE. The reference of PuÈya nakœatra (Beta Arietes) at Vernal equinox in Rigveda leads also to 7300 BCE. 5. KD Abhyankar (1993) has shown that the sacrificial year started near the winter solstice marked by the heliacal rising of the AœvinÁ (Aries) nakœatra during the earliest Vedic astronomy dating back to 7000 BCE noting that the winter solstice occurs now in MÂla nakœatra with nirayana longitude of 247o. 6. The Rigveda also refers to Punarvasu (Pollax) at Vernal equinox which leads to 6100 BCE. The reference of RevatÁ (Pisces) at\n371 winter solstice also indicates 6000 BCE. 7. The Aitareya BrÀhmaõa refers to Aditi or Punarvasu (Castor and Pollax) being exactly at the East point which leads to 6000 BCE. 8. Rigveda (1.117.22 & 1.84.10) refers to the winter solstice in AœvinÁ that occurred around 6000 BCE. 9. The star Agastya was known to Indians since the Rig Vedic period. According to KD Abhyankar, the star Agastya (Canopus) became visible for the first time in India at KanyÀkumari around 10,000 BCE, at Chennai around 8500 BCE, at Hyderabad around 7200 BCE, in the Vindhya region around 5200 BCE and at Delhi around 3100 BCE. The epoch of the Puranic story about Agastya who crossed the Vindhya Mountains cannot be later than 5000 BCE. Ancient Tamil literature tells us that the first Saôgam was supposedly started by Agastya. A total of three Saôgams were patronised by 89, 59 and 49 Pandya kings respectively. Thus, the history of 197 Pandya kings of the Saôgam period ought to have started around 5000 BCE. Recently, an ancient royal silver ring with an inscription in the ancient Tamil Brahmi script has been found from the Amaravathi riverbed at Karur in Tamilnadu. The inscription reads \"Peruvazhuthi\". Peruvazhuthi is the name of a Pandyan King. The full name of the Pandyan King was Palyagasalai Mutukutumi Peruvazhuthi who finds mention in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature. 10. Balagangadhar Tilak dated the composition of the Rigveda around 4500 BCE based on the position of the vernal equinox in the constellation of MÃigaœirÀ (Orion). In Rigveda, MÃigaœirÀ nakœatra is mentioned as “°grahÀyaõa” which means the starting of the year. Tilak described the positions of the solstices and equinoxes around 4500 BCE as “We have, roughly speaking, the winter solstice quite near the asterism of Uttara BhÀdrapada, the vernal equinox between the head and right shoulder of Orion or about 3o east of MÃigaœirÀ, the summer solstice at a distance of within 2o east of Uttara PhÀlgunÁ, and the autumnal equinox about 5o east of the asterism of MÂla”. THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n372 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 11. Hermann Jacobi pointed out that the sun was in PhÀlgunÁ as referred to in the Rigveda and the Atharva Veda and that the full moon was in BhÀdrapada during the summer solstice as referred to in ŒÀnkhÀyana and Gobhila GÃihyasÂtra; this would have occurred at 4500-2500 BCE. 12. In 1789 CE, John Playfair demonstrated that the epoch of the astronomical observations recorded in the tables still in use among Hindu astrologers had to be 4300 BCE. 13. KauœÁtakÁ BrÀhmaõa (4.4) mentions about the full moon night in PhÀlguna as beginning of the year which corresponds to 4000 BCE. 14. The Aitareya BrÀhmaõa refers to the shifting of Vernal equinox from MÃigaœirÀ to RohiõÁ; that indicates 3100 BCE. 15. According to RN Iyengar, TaittirÁya °raõyaka contains a hymn equating Abhaya and Dhruva which is none other than the star α-Draconis (Thuban) that was nearest to the North Celestial Pole during the period 3200-2400 BCE. Actually, the Dhruva mentioned in Vedic and Puranic literature was a star located at the tail of a celestial animal figure known as ŒiœumÀra or the Dolphin. This constellation is nothing but the modern Draco. The body parts of the animal figure are made of 14 stars, the last four of which, including Dhruva on the tail, are said to have never set. The TaittirÁya °raõyaka of Krishõa Yajurveda School describes this constellation by the same name (ŒiœumÀra) and lists 14 stars, of which the last was Abhaya, equated with Dhruva, at the tail end. The EkÀgni kÀnda of the Krishõa Yajurveda School recommends the observation of Dhruva, the fixed pole star, during marriages. 16. The reference to the full moon in PÂrva PhÀlgunÁ marking New Year in the Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa and the KauœÁtakÁ BrÀhmaõa leads to 3000 BCE. The Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa mentions that the VaiœÀkha new moon coincided with RohiõÁ nakœatra which also leads to 3000 BCE. 17. The Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa mentions that KÃittikÀs (Pleiades) rise in the true east and never deviate from the east and that the\n373 constellation SaptarÈis (Great Bear or Ursa Major) rises in the north (KÃittikÀ ha vai pÂrvato na chyavante uttarÀ hi saptarÈayaÍ). This leads to 2950 BCE. 18. The list of nakœatras beginning with KÃittikÀ also indicates that it might have been drawn up in 3000 BCE. 19. Balagangadhar Tilak pointed out that the occurrence of the winter solstice with the full moon of MÀgha at the time of the TaittirÁya SaÉhitÀ corresponded to 2350 BCE. The Atharva Veda also mentions the occurrence of the winter solstice with the full moon of MaghÀ (Ayanam MaghÀsu ca). 20. The TaittirÁya BrÀhmaõa (1.5.2.7) classifies the nakœatras into two groups namely Devanakœatras and Yamanakœatras. Thirteen and a half nakœatras ending with ViœÀkhÀ were situated in the northern hemisphere (Deva) and the remaining nakœatras ending with BharaõÁ were in the southern hemisphere (Yama). This corresponds to 2300 BCE. 21. MaitrÀyanÁya °raõyaka UpaniÈad (6.14) refers to the winter solstice being at the mid-point of the ŒrÀviÈÇhÀ segment and the summer solstice at the beginning of MaghÀ. This indicates 1660 BCE. This text (1.4) also records an observation about the drifting of the fixed pole star, Dhruva which also leads to the same period. 22. The VedÀnga JyotiÈa mentions that the Winter Solstice starts from the beginning of ŒrÀviÈÇhÀ (Delphini) and the Summer Solstice from the middle of °œleÈa which leads to1400 BCE. In case, ŒrÀviÈÇhÀ is identified as β Delphini than this is date to be corrected to 1800 BCE. 23. William Jones concluded, based on the information available in the BÃihat SaÉhitÀ of VarÀhamihira, that PÀrÀœara muni lived in 1180 BCE. However, F. Wilford mentions that as per Davis, PÀrÀœara lived around 1390 BCE. RN Iyengar also came to the same conclusion in his book “PÀrÀœaratantra” that the date of PÀrÀœara must be around 1150-1370 BCE. PÀrÀœara describes the six Indian seasons in terms of the position of the Sun in the different nakœatra segments which leads to 1150-1370 BCE. THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n374 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA All of the above not only provide irrefutable proof of the antiquity and continuity of Vedic civilisation since 10,000 BCE but also the Vedic tradition of multi-generational record keeping of astronomical observations in a scientific manner which gives us glimpses of how astronomy evolved in ancient India. The archaeological findings at the Gulf of Khambhat, Gobekli Tepe, and Nevali Cori provide evidence that the antiquity of Vedic civilisation goes back to 10,000 BCE whereas the findings at Mehargarh, Lahuradeva, Jusi, etc. indicate the development of agrarian Vedic civilisation since 7000 BCE. In view of the above, the speculative theory of the Aryan invasion does not even merit discussion here. Many scholars have already exposed this baseless, fraudulent and racially motivated theory. Vedic civilisation was originally born in the region of Sapta Sindhu and spread eastwards and southwards. The regular migration of some families of Vedic civilisation towards the north-west since ancient times culturally influenced the Northern Iran and Anatolian regions which contain some footprints of Vedic civilisation. Western scholars also concocted another myth and trumpeted it as their fundamental discovery of the origins of the Indo-European language family. According to them, six ancient languages – Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Gothic (ancestor of the Germanic languages), Celtic (ancestor of Irish and Welsh) and Old Persian are very similar and that they must have descended from an original common language. They speculated that a Proto Indo-European language ought to have been the common ancestor of all Indo-European languages. Vedic Sanskrit is older than the other Indo-European languages. Therefore, it is fundamentally wrong to club Vedic Sanskrit with other Indo-European languages. Actually, there were two different language families i.e. the Anatolia- European language family and the Indo-Iranian language family. Vedic Sanskrit was born out of a proto Indo-Iranian language that originated in the region of Sapta Sindhu. Most probably, a proto language which originated in Anatolia was the common ancestor of the Anatolia- European languages. Since Vedic civilisation and its descendant civilisation of India was the leader in knowledge and dominated the\n375 world culturally and economically for thousands of years, it is very likely that the ancient Anatolia-European languages have borrowed heavily from Sanskrit; this explains why comparative philology has found similarities between Sanskrit and the Anatolia-European languages. Another false theory propagated by some historians is that the Vedic people did not have knowledge of writing because the Vedas are known as “Œruti” meaning the texts learnt by listening. This theory can easily be rejected by the study of the Vedic Sanskrit language in which the Vedas were written. Vedic Sanskrit follows the rules of classical Sanskrit grammar substantially. This means the majority of the rules of Sanskrit grammar evolved and were well established during the Rig Vedic period. It is grossly incorrect to say that the entire grammar of Sanskrit evolved after Vedic literature came into existence. Some provisions of Sanskrit grammar like Saôdhi (conjunctions), context-free grammar etc. were artificially introduced into the Sanskrit language to ensure the continuity of the musical rhythm of the human voice and the freedom of using words anywhere in the sentences because Vedic hymns were written in verses. No language in the world except Sanskrit or other Indian languages derived from Sanskrit has the provision of Saôdhi (conjunctions) and context-free grammar because these are artificial provisions. The perfect rules of conjunctions and context-free grammar cannot be naturally evolved. Vedic Rishis had envisaged the need for developing a flawless, infallible and perfect language for performing Vedic rituals and preserving knowledge. During this process, the Vedic Rishis evolved a strict grammatical regulatory system based on the processing of phonetic alphabets due to which Sanskrit emerged as a perfect & sacred language. Sanskrit also became the language of learned people during the Rig Vedic period itself due to grammatical restrictions and artificial improvisations. Evidently, the Vedas were written when the purification of Sanskrit by grammar attained an advanced stage. Vedic Rishis also developed meters (CÍandas) for the writing of Vedic hymns in verse because it is easier to learn and memorize verse than prose. Vedic meters were based on the concept of processing long and short syllables. Incidentally, Vedic Rishis also progressed in the THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n376 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA knowledge of applied sciences like arithmetic, geometry, astronomy etc. Vedas were referred to as “Œruti” because these texts were worshiped as sacred texts. It was strongly believed that the Vedas must be learnt by listening from gurus because any error in pronunciation was treated as a serious offence. It is completely baseless to conclude that Vedic people did not know how to write because the Vedas were learnt by listening. Vedic people definitely had a well-evolved script because: \u0002 The perfect rules of conjunction (Saôdhi) as followed by the Vedas cannot be evolved without the invention of a script based on phonetic alphabets. \u0002 The provision of context-free grammar is also not possible without the invention of a script. \u0002 The evolution of phonetic alphabets is also not possible without a script. \u0002 The evolution of meters based on long and short syllables is also not possible without a script. Another misunderstanding that prevailed among some historians is about pre-PÀõinian Sanskrit (Vedic Sanskrit) vs. post-PÀõinian Sanskrit (classical Sanskrit). According to some historians, PÀõini was the first to introduce Sanskrit grammar and therefore, they concluded that any treatise written in classical Sanskrit must be dated after PÀõini. Many historians treated that as literary evidence to fix the date of classical Sanskrit literature. Eurocentric scholars propagated this theory as strong literary evidence and deliberately underestimated the date of PÀõini around 400 BCE so that the entire body of classical Sanskrit literature could be dated after PÀõini. It is noteworthy that PÀõini himself refers to more than 10 treatises of Sanskrit grammar (ŒakaÇÀyana, ŒÀkalya, Senaka, GÀrgya, GÀlava, etc.) which existed prior to his work. In reality, PÀõini just compiled the rules of Sanskrit grammar which were already well established prior to his work. PÀõini’s greatest contribution is the presentation of Sanskrit grammar in its entirety employing a minimum number of SÂtras and with as minimum a number of words as possible. The concept of pre- PÀõinian Sanskrit vs. post-PÀõinian Sanskrit is grossly incorrect.\n377 It may be confidently asserted that the evolution of Sanskrit grammar started in the early Vedic period, reached an advanced level in the Mid Vedic period and was fully established by the post Vedic period. The PrÀtiœÀkhyas (the earliest texts of Sanskrit grammar), written before the period of the BrÀhmaõas (3000 BCE) are clear evidence of the evolution of Sanskrit Grammar. During the post Vedic period, many °charyas attempted to present the rules of Sanskrit grammar adopting scientific methods. It was also a challenge to present the rules of Sanskrit grammar in its entirety in a minimum number of Sutras and with as minimum a number of words as possible. Finally, Panini’s AÈÇÀdhyÀyÁ emerged as the best presentation of the already existing rules of Sanskrit grammar ensuring scientific methodology and brevity. Many scholars, including western scholars, declared that Sanskrit grammar as presented by PÀõini is one of the greatest creations of human intelligence. As it is humanly impossible to do so in one generation, it is obvious that many generations contributed towards the development and evolution of Sanskrit grammar since the Rig Vedic period and it reached its zenith during the period of PÀõini. The script of the inscriptions found at Vikramkhol, JhÀrsuguda in Sambalpur district of Orissa is undoubtedly the distant ancestor of the early Brahmi script and the most ancient script used in India. Possibly, the script of the Vikramkhol inscriptions may belong to the mid Vedic era. Most of the Vedic hymns were probably written between 8000 BCE to 6000 BCE. The available texts of the Vedas were finally compiled and edited during the period 6000-3500 BCE. Possibly, certain texts of the Vedic branches may have been finally updated during the period 4000- 2500 BCE. The entire Vedic civilisation has evolved in four distinct stages: 1. Proto Vedic era \u0002 Vedic civilisation starts evolving in (10000-8000 BCE) the region of Sapta Sindhu. \u0002 Vedic Sanskrit starts evolving from the Proto Indo-Iranian language. \u0002 Some families of Vedic civilisation migrate to Eastern Europe. THE ANTIQUITY OF VEDIC CIVILIZATION\n378 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 2. Early Vedic era \u0002 Vedic Sanskrit and a phonetic script (8000-5500 BCE) evolve. \u0002 Most of the Vedic hymns are written. \u0002 The tradition of astronomical observations is fully established. \u0002 Agrarian revolution start before 7000 BCE. 3. Mid Vedic era \u0002 A Phonetic script and Vedic Sanskrit (5500-3500 BCE) are fully evolved by 6000 BCE. \u0002 The Vedas are compiled and edited. \u0002 The early Surya SiddhÀnta is written by Maya. \u0002 Classical Sanskrit fully evolved by 5200 BCE. \u0002 The glorious kings of the SÂryavaÉœa or IkœvÀku dynasty reign at AyodhyÀ. \u0002 MaharÈi VÀlmiki authors the RÀmÀyaõa around 5050 BCE. 4. Post Vedic era \u0002 Urbanisation and development of (3500-1650 BCE) cities in full swing. \u0002 The Saraswati River gradually disappears around 4000-3000 BCE. \u0002 The MahÀbhÀrata war takes place in 3128 BCE. \u0002\n379 The epochs of various ancient Indian eras, the antiquity of Vedic civilisation and the chronology of ancient Indian civilisation can be presented in seven distinct stages as follows: 1. Proto Vedic period 10,000 – 8000 BCE 2. Early Vedic period 8000 – 5500 BCE 3. Mid Vedic period 5500 – 3500 BCE 4. Post Vedic Period 3500 – 1650 BCE 5. Imperial era or Early Classical period 1650 - 200 BCE 6. Classical period 200 BCE–650 CE 7. Early Mediaeval period 650-1200 CE Proto Vedic period (10,000-8000 BCE) The beginnings of ancient Vedic civilisation may be assertively claimed to have started its journey of evolution at the start of the Holocene or the epoch of the so-called Neolithic revolution (12,000 BCE); the foundations of Vedic civilisation were laid around 10,000 BCE in the region of Sapta Sindhu (Saraswati, Sindhu and the five rivers of Punjab). Some families / groups belonging to this period of Vedic civilisation migrated to Central Asia and Eastern Europe as conclusively proven by the genome studies and archaeological findings in the South-eastern Anatolian region (Turkey). Traditionally, Vedic Rishis were deeply engaged in language studies and laid strong foundations for the evolution of Vedic Sanskrit from the Proto Indo-Iranian language at an early date. They also founded the tradition of multi-generational record-keeping of astronomical",

Vedic civilisation had also acquired the essential knowledge and experience to augur the agrarian revolution by 7500 BCE, and this period also witnessed considerable internal migration. Early Vedic period (8000 – 5500 BCE) Vedic civilisation transformed into an agrarian society around 7500- 7000 BCE according to the archaeological findings at Mehargarh, Lahuradeva, and Jhusi. Interestingly, Vedic Rishis seem to have invented a primitive phonetic script that revolutionised language studies at a very early stage. Elementary Vedic Sanskrit grammar, the rules of conjunction (sandhi), context-free grammar and the rules of CÍandas (meters) started evolving by 7500 BCE and quite possibly, the script used in the inscriptions found at Vikramkhol, Jharsuguda in Sambalpur district of Orissa may belong to the early and mid-Vedic period. This script is undoubtedly anterior to the Brahmi script. Most of the hymns of the Rigveda and Yajurveda were written around 8000-7000 BCE and various branches of the Vedas also evolved during the period 7000 BCE to 5500 BCE. The lunisolar calendar and the cycle of five year Yuga system were very likely Indian inventions that were in place by 7000 BCE. Indian astronomy scaled new heights when Maya wrote the earliest version of SÂrya SiddhÀnta at the end of the KÃta Yuga i.e. around 5600-5500 BCE. The first SÂrya VaÚœÁ King IkœvÀku may have founded his kingdom around 6776-6700 BCE. Some significant dates of the early Vedic Period are: 8000-7000 BCE The hymns of Rigveda and Yajurveda are written and the earliest form of phonetic script possibly developed. 7500-7000 BCE The beginning of the agrarian revolution. 7500-7000 BCE The use of the Lunisolar calendar and the cycle of five year Yuga system. (Interestingly, the first astronomical revolution coincided with the first agrarian revolution.)\n381 7000-5500 BCE The evolution of the various branches of the Vedas. 6776-6700 BCE King IkœvÀku founds the kingdom of SÂrya VaÚœa. 6700-5500 BCE The duration of KÃta Yuga. 6200 BCE MÀndhÀtÀ, the most illustrious King of the KÃta Yuga reigns. 5600-5500 BCE Maya authors the earliest version of SÂrya SiddhÀnta at the end of the KÃta Yuga. Mid-Vedic period (5500-3500 BCE) Vedic people continued their in-depth study of language due to which classical Sanskrit started evolving. Possibly, the basics of advanced Sanskrit fully evolved and classical Sanskrit came into popular use by the end of the KÃta Yuga i.e. 5500 BCE. RÀma, the most illustrious king of the SÂrya VaÚœa, was born in 5114 BCE and MaharÈi VÀlmiki wrote the RÀmÀyaõa, the “°dikÀvya” (the first poetry in classical Sanskrit) around 5050 BCE. Various branches of the Vedas undertook an initiative to formally edit and compile the hymns of Rigveda, Yajurveda and SÀmaveda according to their traditions around 5000 BCE. Most probably, the presently available texts of the Rigveda, Yajurveda and SÀmaveda were finally edited and compiled around 4500-3500 BCE. Some significant dates of the Mid-Vedic Period are: 5500 BCE The evolution of classical Sanskrit and the basics of advanced Sanskrit grammar. 5500-4300 BCE The duration of TretÀ Yuga. 5114 BCE The birth of the greatest King RÀma. 5050 BCE MaharÈi VÀlmiki authors the earliest version of RÀmÀyaõa. 5000 BCE The first king of the PÀndya dynasty reigns in what is today Tamilnadu and the first Saôgam is convened under the guidance of MaharÈi Agastya. 4500-3500 BCE The texts of Rigveda, Yajurveda and SÀmaveda are finally edited and compiled. AN OUTLINE OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA\n382 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 4500-4000 BCE Some old ŒrautasÂtras like LÀÇyÀyana, °œvalÀyana, ŒÀôkhÀyana etc. may have been written prior to the disappearance of the Saraswati River. Interestingly, these ŒrautasÂtras refer to the Saraswati as a perennial river. Gobhila GÃhyasÂtra was also written during this period. 4300-3100 BCE The duration of DvÀpara Yuga. 4000 BCE KauÈÁtakÁ BrÀhmaõa is written. Post Vedic period (3500-1650 BCE) The Saraswati was the mightiest river of ancient India and flowed in all her splendour up to 4000 BCE. Œutudri (Sutlej), YamunÀ and DÃÈadvati rivers were the main tributaries of the Saraswati. According to geological studies, the Saraswati originated in the glaciers of western Garhwal. Due to major tectonic activities in the Siwalik Hills, the decline of the Saraswati possibly commenced around 4000 BCE. The Sutlej suddenly shifted her course westwards and became a tributary of the Indus and probably at the same time, the YamunÀ also started flowing eastwards to be another tributary of the GaôgÀ by 3500 BCE. Thus, the sudden diversion of the Sutlej and the YamunÀ as well as the melting glaciers of Garhwal reduced the Saraswati to be dependent on the DÃÈadvati and seasonal streams by 3500 BCE and eventually, by 3000 BCE, both the Saraswati and the DÃÈadvati dried up completely. Politically, the great kingdom of SÂrya VaÚœa declined by 4200-4000 BCE. Kuru founded the reign of the Kaurava dynasty and shifted the capital from PrayÀga to Kurukœetra around 3900 BCE. BÃhadratha I founded the reign of BÃhadratha dynasty in Magadha and made Girivraja or RÀjagÃha as his capital around 3700 BCE. GopÀla also founded the reign of the GopÀla dynasty in Nepal around 3700 BCE and at the same time, Naraka and Bhagadatta established the reign of their dynasty in KÀmarÂpa (Assam) around 3700 BCE. Gonanda I reigned in Kashmir around 3147 BCE and was the contemporary of the Magadha king JarÀsandha. The MahÀbhÀrata war took place around 3128 BCE.\n383 AN OUTLINE OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Various BrÀhmaõas, °raõyakas, PrÀtiœÀkhyas, UpaniÈads, and ŒulbasÂtras were written during this period. Some important dates of the post Vedic period are: 4000-3000 BCE The disappearance of the Saraswati River and the decline of Indus-Saraswati civilisation. 3900 BCE King Kuru founds the Kaurava dynasty in Kurukœetra. 3700 BCE BÃhadratha I founds his dynasty in Magadha. 3700 BCE GopÀla I reigns in Nepal and Naraka or Bhagadatta reigns in KÀmarÂpa (Assam). 3148-3147 BCE Gonanda I reigns in Kashmir and JarÀsandha of BÃhadratha dynasty in Magadha. 3128 BCE The year of the MahÀbhÀrata war and the coronation of King YudhiÈÇhira. 3102 BCE The epoch of the Kaliyuga era commences in 3102 BCE. Various SiddhÀntas of Indian astronomy started evolving around 5000-3000 BCE. SÂrya SiddhÀnta was completely updated and the concept of MahÀyugas and 14 Manvantaras was introduced in Astronomy. The earlier Yuga of 1200 years was multiplied by 360 to get 432000 years and introduced the differential duration of Yugas in a ratio 4:3:2:1 i.e. KÃta (432000 x 4), TretÀ (432000 x 3), DvÀpara (432000 x 2) and Kali (432000 x 1). 3500-2500 BCE Atharvaveda is finally edited and compiled. 3200-3100 BCE The date of the Aitareya BrÀhmaõa. 3200-2400 BCE The date of the TaittirÁya °raõyaka. 3200-2500 BCE The BrÀhmÁ script evolves probably from an ancient phonetic script (the script used in the Vikramkhol inscriptions) and becomes popular over the whole of India by the MahÀbhÀrata era and later becomes the\n384 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA root of all other Indian scripts. It is quite likely that the script found on the seals of Indus-Saraswati civilisation was used by the BÀhlÁkas, who were ruling in the western parts of ancient India around 4000-3000 BCE; gradually, the KharoÈÇhÁ script evolved and becomes popular in the western parts of ancient India around 3000-2500 BCE. The Yavanas, who used YavanÀni script (later adopted by ancient Greeks), emerged as powerful kings after 3000 BCE. The Rabatak inscription of KaniÈka (1950-1910 BCE) found in 1993 CE in Afghanistan is written in YavanÀni or the so-called ancient Greek script that clearly tells us that KaniÈka introduced the Aryan language (Sanskrit) and script by replacing the Yavana language and script. Thus, the Yavanas gradually learnt Sanskrit and became Indianised. 3000-2000 BCE The date of various ŒulbasÂtras (BaudhÀyana, °pastamba, MÀnava, KÀtyÀyana etc.). 2950 BCE The date of Œatapatha BrÀhmaõa. 2719-2718 BCE °ryabhaÇa writes his astronomical work titled “°ryabhaÇÁyam”. (TS Narayana Sastry claims that many old manuscripts of °ryabhaÇÁyam mention the birth of °ryabhaÇa in the 360th year elapsed (2742 BCE) and not the 3600th year elapsed (498 CE) from the epoch of Kaliyuga. VarÀhamihira (156-74 BCE) used the verb “JagÀda” in remote past tense which unambiguously indicates that °ryabhaÇa was not his contemporary. Interestingly, all astronomical texts written after the epoch of the Œaka era (583 BCE) invariably refer to the Œaka era except °ryabhaÇÁyam which indicates that °ryabhaÇa flourished prior to the introduction of the Œaka era (583 BCE). Therefore, °ryabhaÇa cannot be dated around 476 CE or 498 CE.)\n385 AN OUTLINE OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA 2700-2600 BCE LÀÇadeva, the disciple of °ryabhaÇa, may have authored “SÂrya SiddhÀnta”. (It appears that LÀÇadeva tried to establish a balance between the traditional approach and radical (scientific) approaches of °ryabhaÇa.) 2300 BCE The date of the TaittirÁya BrÀhmaõa. 2200-2000 BCE Yavaneœvara writes “YavanasiddhÀnta” or “HorÀrthaœÀstra” in the Yavana language (Bactrian or BÀhlÁka language). Sphujidhvaja, the later king of the Yavanas, translates it into Sanskrit around 1500-1000 BCE. (The same Sanskrit translation of Sphujidhvaja was re-produced as “YavanajÀtakam” by an unknown author after Œaka 56 (528-527 BCE). This unknown author writes the 79th chapter of YavanajÀtaka with the objective of presenting the Yavana siddhÀnta with reference to lunisolar astronomy). 3138-2132 BCE The reign of BÃhadratha dynasty. 2500-2200 BCE The establishment of TakœaœilÀ University. 2214-2213 BCE The birth of Buddha on 6th April 2214 BCE. According to Tibetan Sa-skya-pa scholars, Buddha was born in the Earth-Dragon year (2214-2213 BCE). 2134-2133 BCE Buddha attains MahÀparinirvÀõa on 23rd Mar 2134 BCE. The Tibetan Sa-skya-pa tradition seems to be most authentic and Kalhana’s RÀjataraôgiõÁ also supports it. According to Sa- skya-pa scholars, Buddha attained nirvÀõa in the boundary of the Fire- Pig year (2134 BCE) and the Earth-Mouse year (2133 BCE). 2200-2100 BCE PÀrœvanÀth, the 23rd TÁrthaôkara of the Jainas, a contemporary of Buddha. 2034-1881 BCE Kashmir Kings Aœoka (2034-2000 BCE), Jaloka (2000- 1990 BCE), DÀmodara II (1990-1984 BCE), HuÈka (1984-1960 BCE), JuÈka (1960-1950 BCE), KaniÈka\n386 THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA (1950-1910 BCE) and Abhimanyu (1910-1881 BCE) reign. According to Kalhaõa, HuÈka, JuÈka and KaniÈka flourished 150 years after the date of the nirvÀõa of Buddha.(The Rabatak inscription of KaniÈka is written in ancient Greek script. Actually, this script was used by the Yavanas of Afghanistan, Persia and Central Asia [most probably, the Indian migrants of the early Vedic era] which was referred to by PÀõini as “YavanÀnÁ”. The same script of the Yavanas was later adopted by ancient Greeks. Therefore, the so-called Greek script was originally the script of the Yavanas. It is very likely that the astronomical school of the Yavanas [Yavana SiddhÀnta] influenced Babylonian and Egyptian astronomy.) 1950-1949 BCE The date of the Rabatak inscription of KaniÈka (1st regnal year). 1881 BCE Kashmir King Gonanda III ascends the throne. 2132-1994 BCE The reign of the Pradyota dynasty. 1994-1616 BCE The reign of the ŒiœunÀga dynasty. 2500-2200 BCE The date of “Manusmriti”. 2500-2200 BCE The date of PÀõini and Piôgala (AÈÇÀdhyÀyÁ and CÍandaœÀstra). 1800-1600 BCE The date of “Charaka SaÚhita” and “Sushruta SaÚhita”. 1660 BCE The date of MaitrÀyaõÁya °raõyaka UpaniÈad. The Imperial era or Early Classical period (1650-200 BCE) MahÀpadma Nanda founded a powerful Magadha empire around 1616 BCE or roughly over 1500 years from the date of the MahÀbhÀrata war (3128 BCE). Chandragupta Maurya dethroned the Nandas and established the great Maurya dynasty around 1516 BCE. Later, the Œuôgas, Kaõvas, ŒÀtavÀhanas and Guptas reigned over the Magadha Empire. Mahavira, the 24th Tirthaôkara of Jainas, attained nirvÀõa in 1189 BCE.\n387 AN OUTLINE OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Kautilya’s ArthaœÀstra, VedÀôga JyotiÈa, PÀrÀœaratantra, Pataðjali’s MahÀbhÀÈya, and most of the Ayurveda, SmÃti, & philosophical works were written during this period. The PÀli and PrÀkrit literature of Buddhism and Jainism also came into existence. The outlines of the chronology of Imperial or early classical period are as follows: 1634 BCE According to “Milindapanho”, the Yavana king Milinda reigns 500 years after the date of the nirvÀõa of Buddha. 1616-1516 BCE The reign of the Nanda dynasty. 1606 BCE King Jayavarman of SÂryavaÚœa reigns in Nepal. 1516-1217 BCE The reign of the Maurya dynasty. 1300-1200 BCE KhÀravela of MahÀmeghavÀhana dynasty reigns in Kaliôga. 1261 BCE The birth of Mahavira on 28th Feb 1261 BCE. 1189-88 BCE Mahavira attains nirvÀõa on 22nd Oct 1189 BCE. 1216-916 BCE The reign of the Œuôga dynasty 1000-600 BCE AmarÀvati and NÀgÀrjunakonda emerge as Buddhist centres. 900-600 BCE The reign of the IkœvÀku dynasty in Andhra Pradesh, with Vijayapuri (NÀgÀrjunakonda) as their capital.

Classical period (200 BCE – 650 CE) The Gupta Empire started declining after Skandagupta (199-177 BCE). The rise of the Maukharis in North India and the rise of Yaœodharman in Central India further weakened the Gupta Empire. The Early ChÀlukyas established their kingdom in northern Karnataka by defeating the early RÀÈÇrakÂÇas and KadaÚbas. King VikramÀditya II, also known as Harsha became the king of Ujjain in the 1st century BCE. The PÀnduvaÚœi kings founded their kingdom in Dakœiõa Kosala (Chattisgarh). The PÀla dynasty started ruling in eastern India and the RÀÈÇrakÂÇas defeated the early ChÀlukyas in the South at the end of the 1st century CE. The PratÁhÀras, Chedis, ParamÀras, Chaulukyas, ChÀhamÀnas, GÀhadwÀlas, Chandellas, etc. flourished during this period.\n391 AN OUTLINE OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF ANCIENT INDIA Most of the classical Sanskrit literature came into existence in this period.

Early Medieval Period (650 – 1200 CE) Eminent historians assumed only one epoch, that of 78 CE for the Saka era (583 BCE) & the Salivahana era (78 CE) and also one epoch,\n397 that of 57 BCE for the KÀrttikÀdi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) & the ChaitrÀdi Vikrama era (57 CE). They also wrongly calculated the epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era (403-402 BCE) as being around 248-249 CE and the epoch of the Sri Harsha era (457-456 BCE) as being around 606 CE. This fallacious approach has brought forward the history of ancient India from early classical and classical period to classical and early medieval period. There is a serious need for further research to re-write the entire history of the early medieval period. However, some outlines of the chronology of the early medieval period are: 606-650 CE Siharasa or Sri Harsha, the son of Rasal reigns in Kanauj. 647-733 CE The Later Gaôga kings of Kaliôga : BhÀnudeva II to NarasiÚha IV 690-795 CE The reign of BhavasiÚhadeva and his descendants in Gauda. 700-725 King Harachandra reigns in Kanauj. 777-849 CE The reign of the Gajapati dynasty in Andhra, Kaliôga and Gauda. 738-1301 CE The reign of the later ChÀhamÀnas of SapÀdalakœa or ŒÀkaÚbhari. 729-972 CE The reign of the later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. 757-888 CE The reign of the Gujarat branch of Later RÀÈÇrakÂÇas. 843-1260 CE The reign of the ŒilÀhÀras of North Konkan 903-1120 CE The reign of the later KaccÍapaghÀtas 988-1010 CE The reign of the ŒilÀhÀras of South Konkan 972-1150 CE The reign of the Western ChÀlukyas of KalyÀõi. 958-1068 CE The reign of the later Chaulukyas. 959 CE SomadevasÂri authors “YaœastilakacampÂ”. 984 CE Udayana writes “LakœaõÀvatÁ”. 1000-1317 CE The reign of the later YÀdavas of Devagiri.

The Saka era commenced in 583 BCE whereas the Salivahana era commenced in 78 CE. • The Karttikadi Vikrama era and the Chaitradi Vikrama era are also not identical. The Karttikadi Vikrama era commenced in 719-718 BCE whereas the Chaitradi Vikrama era commenced in 57 BCE. • The Indian king “Sandrokottus” mentioned by the ancient Greek historians was Samudragupta and not Chandragupta Maurya. • The Yavanas mentioned in ancient Indian literature were the immediate north-western neighbours of India and not the Greeks; they have been a part of Indian civilisation much before the date of the Mahabharata war i.e.3128 BCE. • The epoch of Gupta era and the epoch of Valabhi era are not identical. The Gupta era commenced in 335 BCE whereas the Valabhi era commenced in 319 CE. • The epoch of the Sri Harsha era commenced in 457 BCE and not in 606 CE. • The epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 403- 402 BCE and not in 248-249 CE. • Buddha attained nirvana not later than 1658 BCE; the date was very likely to have been 2134 BCE as recorded in the tradition of Tibetan Sa-skya-pa scholars. • Mahavira attained nirvana on 22nd Oct 1189 BCE and not in 527 BCE.",
